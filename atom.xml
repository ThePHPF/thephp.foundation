            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow. Can you believe it? Just three years (and one day) ago, PHP had no organization behind it. Only two people were being paid to work on the language that powers 70% of the web.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the very first announcement about the creation of the PHP Foundation: 
<a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/">The New Life of PHP ‚Äì The PHP Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fast-forward-to-today">Fast forward to today</h2>

<p>We now have a team of 10 talented engineers dedicated to PHP. We‚Äôre supported by major companies, governments, and an incredible community. That same community is creating amazing projects with PHP, while businesses continue to thrive thanks to a mature, secure, and performant language.</p>

<p>Since 2021, we‚Äôve seen three PHP releases‚ÄîPHP 8.2, 8.3, and the freshly released <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.4/en.php">PHP 8.4</a>. Here are just a few highlights from these releases, developed by the PHP Foundation team:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property hooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/asymmetric-visibility-v2">Asymmetric Visibility</a></li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/saner-inc-dec-operators">Saner Increment/Decrement operators</a></li>
<li>Multiple type system improvements: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null-false-standalone-types">null and false as stand-alone types</a>, <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dnf_types">Disjunctive Normal Form Types</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="feature-development-is-only-about-20%25-of-what-the-foundation-team-does">Feature development is only about 20% of what the foundation team does</h2>

<p>Behind the scenes, there‚Äôs a lot more: triaging and fixing issues, handling security reports, reviewing code, updating documentation, and maintaining infrastructure. All of this work empowers the community and ensures PHP is stable and reliable.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The total contributions to the PHP repositories grew by 51+%</li>
<li>We conducted the first external security audit for PHP in 10 years</li>
<li>We extended security support for PHP versions by one year</li>
<li>We improved CI and testing infrastructure</li>
<li>We introduced automated benchmarks to track performance regressions</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this would be possible without our sponsors. Huge thanks to every company and individual who has supported us over the past three years!</p>

<p>Special shout-outs to:<br />
JetBrains, Automattic, Sovereign Tech Agency, Craft CMS, Private Packagist, Tideways, Zend by Perforce, Laravel, Symfony, Mercari Inc., Les-Tilleuls.coop, pixiv Inc., Aternos GmbH, Sentry, Ardennes-√©tape, Cybozu,</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to announce that after a year of hard work, dedication, and collaboration, <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.4/"><strong>PHP 8.4</strong></a> is officially here!</p>

<p>Thanks to the tireless efforts of the PHP Foundation members, the core PHP development team, and an incredible community of contributors, this upcoming version brings major new features and syntax, performance and security enhancements, and a healthy amount of deprecations.</p>

<h2 id="a-year-of-hard-work-and-collaboration">A Year of Hard Work and Collaboration</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation financially supports ten PHP core developers. The PHP Foundation members, along with a total of <strong>115 contributors</strong>, have made over <strong>2,600 commits</strong> since PHP 8.3 until PHP 8.4.0 release.</p>

<p>PHP 8.4 includes changes from <strong>36 RFCs</strong>. There have also been numerous mailing list discussions and RFCs that were withdrawn, declined, or are still under discussion.</p>

<p>Since PHP 8.0, PHP 8.4 received the highest number of RFCs, and PHP 8.4 brings the changes such as property hooks and asymmetric visibility that received significant community involvement and refinement.</p>

<h2 id="what-php-8.4-brings">What PHP 8.4 Brings</h2>

<p>PHP 8.4 brings numerous new features and improvements to PHP. We covered some of them in our <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/02/php-core-roundup-19">previous post</a> as well, but they are mentioned here as well, for more complete picture.</p>

<p>As we also covered in <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/02/php-core-roundup-19">PHP Core Roundup #19</a>, Property Hooks and Asymmetric Visibility are two of the highlighted features in PHP 8.4</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="php-8.4-supports-property-hooks%21">PHP 8.4 supports Property Hooks!</h3>

<p>In PHP 8.4, it is possible for a class to declare class properties with "hooks", that get executed when the property is accessed or set, and the hooks can access the object context.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.property-hooks.php">Property hooks</a> open up a wide range of use cases that allow classes to declare virtual properties that enable expressive and intuitive APIs, make code readable and simple and avoid boilerplate code.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {

    public string $emailAddress {
        set {
            if (!filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
                throw new ValueError('emailAddress property must be a valid email address');
            }
            $this-&gt;emailAddress = $value;
        }
    }

}

$user = new User();
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'test@example.com'; // Allowed  
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'not an email address'; // Throws ValueError  
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Crell">Larry Garfield</a> wrote in <a href="/blog/2024/11/01/how-hooks-happened/">PHP 8.4: How Property Hooks Happened</a> about how he and Ilija Tovilo üíú brought Property Hooks to PHP.</p>

<h3 id="asymmetric-visibility">Asymmetric Visibility</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 introduces <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php#language.oop5.visibility-members-aviz">asymmetric visibility</a>, allowing different access levels for getting and setting class properties. This feature is useful when you want to expose a property for reading but not writing.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {  
 public private(set) int $userId;  
 public function __construct() { $this-&gt;userId = 42; }  
}  

$user = new User();  
echo $user-&gt;userId; // 42  

$user-&gt;userId = 16; // Error: Cannot modify private(set) property  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="lazy-objects">Lazy Objects</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 brings support for Lazy Objects. Using the Reflection API, it is possible to create class instances in PHP 8.4 that they are initialized only if needed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.lazy-objects.php">Lazy Objects documentation</a> provides detailed examples and use cases.</p>

<h3 id="html5-compliant-parser-in-dom-extension">HTML5-compliant parser in DOM Extension</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 upgrades the DOM extension with HTML5-compliant parsing. The new <code>Dom\HTMLDocument</code> and <code>Dom\XMLDocument</code> classes replace libxml2, which previously lacked HTML5 support. These updates improve DOM spec compliance and add features like CSS selector support.</p>

<h3 id="bcmath-adds-operator-overloaded-%60bcmath%5Cnumber%60-class">BCMath adds operator-overloaded <code>BcMath\Number</code> class</h3>

<p>The BCMath extension now includes the <code>BcMath\Number</code> class, enabling operator overloading for arithmetic operations.</p>

<pre><code class="php">use BcMath\Number;  

$num1 = new Number('22');  
$num2 = new Number('7');  
$num3 = new Number('100');  

$result = ($num1 / $num2) + $num1 - $num2;  
echo $result; // 18.1428571428
</code></pre>

<p>You can now use standard operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>) with <code>BcMath\Number</code> objects, which also support all <code>bc*</code> functions.</p>

<p>These objects are immutable and implement the <code>Stringable</code> interface, so they can be used in string contexts like <code>echo $num</code>.</p>

<h3 id="new-functions">New Functions</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/array_find"><code>array_find</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/array_find_key"><code>array_find_key</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/array_any"><code>array_any</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/array_all"><code>array_all</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/bcdivmod"><code>bcdivmod</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/bcround"><code>bcround</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/bcceil"><code>bcceil</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/bcfloor"><code>bcfloor</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/mb_trim"><code>mb_trim</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/mb_ltrim"><code>mb_ltrim</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/mb_rtrim"><code>mb_rtrim</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/mb_ucfirst"><code>mb_ucfirst</code></a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/mb_lcfirst"><code>mb_lcfirst</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/grapheme_str_split"><code>grapheme_str_split</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/fpow"><code>fpow</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/http_get_last_response_headers"><code>http_get_last_response_headers</code></a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/http_clear_last_response_headers"><code>http_clear_last_response_headers</code></a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pdo-driver-specific-subclasses">PDO Driver-Specific Subclasses</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pdo_driver_specific_subclasses">PDO Driver-specific subclasses</a> RFC is implemented in PHP 8.4. Previously, it was voted for PHP 8.3 but was not implemented in PHP 8.3 before its feature-freeze.</p>

<p>PHP 8.4 now adds <code>Pdo\Mysql</code>, <code>Pdo\Pgsql</code>, <code>Pdo\Sqlite</code>, <code>Pdo\DbLib</code>, and <code>Pdo\Firebird</code> classes that extend the <code>PDO</code> class. Driver-specific methods, properties, and constants are now available in the driver-specific subclass. Driver-specific sub classes also allow APIs to be more expressive and restrictive by allowing the functions and methods only to accept/return driver-specific sub-classes.</p>

<h3 id="%60aegis-128l%60-and-%60aegis256%60-support-in-sodium-extension"><code>AEGIS-128L</code> and <code>AEGIS256</code> support in Sodium extension</h3>

<p><strong>AEGIS</strong> is an AES-based family of authenticated encryption algorithms that is faster than AES-GCM. The Sodium extension in PHP 8.4 supports <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sodium-crypto-aead-aegis128l-encrypt.php"><code>AEGIS-128L</code></a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sodium-crypto-aead-aegis256-encrypt.php"><code>AEGIS256</code></a> encryption algorithms if the Sodium extension is compiled with <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium"><code>libsodium</code></a> 1.0.19 or later.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Apart from the new features, PHP 8.4 also updates several underlying dependencies and datasets, as well as unbundling three extensions:</p>

<h3 id="updated-dependencies">Updated dependencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Curl extension now requires libcurl 7.61.0 or later, and even capable of making HTTP/3 requests if it is compiled with a supporting TLS library.</li>
<li>The PCRE extension ships with PCRE 10.44, which provides support for Unicode 15 characters and character blocks, improved Regular Expression syntax, and performance improvements on certain systems.</li>
<li>OpenSSL extension now requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later, with improved support for OpenSSL 3.x series. It can now support Curve25519 and Curve448 based keys. Further, OpenSSL can be compiled to provide Argon2 password hashing on OpenSSL 3.2+ on PHP NTS builds.</li>
<li>To compile PHP as an Apache module (<code>mod_php</code>), PHP 8.4 drops support for the EOL Apache 2.0 and 2.2 series. The minimum required Apache version is now 2.4.</li>
<li>The zlib extension now requires zlib version 1.2.11 at minimum.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unbundled-extensions">Unbundled Extensions</h3>

<p><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unbundle_imap_pspell_oci8">IMAP, Pspell, OCI8, and PDO_OCI8 extensions</a> are unbundled from the PHP core, and are now available as PECL extensions, for which <a href="/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/">PIE might help</a> to install easily.</p>

<h3 id="updated-php-icon-on-windows">Updated PHP Icon on Windows</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 also brings a minor, yet <em>very</em> overdue change to the PHP icon on Windows executables:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="center"></th>
  <th align="center"></th>

  <td align="center"><img src="/assets/post-images/2024/php84/php-icon-old.png" alt="old PHP logo in Windows php.exe" /></td>

  <td align="center">Old Icon</td>
  <td align="center">New Icon</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="looking-ahead%3A-php-8.4-and-beyond">Looking Ahead: PHP 8.4 and Beyond</h2>

<p>PHP 8.4 is the first major new PHP releases since the adoption of the new <a href="/blog/2024/10/02/php-core-roundup-19/#php-release-cycle-updates">PHP maintenance policy</a>. PHP 8.4, along with all current active PHP versions, will receive two years of active support and two years of security fixes.</p>

<p>What this means is that PHP 8.4 will receive bug fixes until the end of 2026 and security fixes until the end of 2028.</p>

<p>We just announced the pre-release of <a href="/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/">PIE - PHP Installer for Extensions</a>. PIE will significantly improve the workflow of downloading and compiling PHP extensions.</p>

<p>PHP 8.5 (in the <code>master</code> branch) is currently under active development, and we already have RFCs such as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures_in_const_expr">Support Closures in constant expressions</a> in voting phase, and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api">Add RFC3986 and WHATWG compliant URI parsing support</a> under discussion.</p>

<h2 id="get-ready-to-upgrade">Get Ready to Upgrade</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/releases/tag/php-8.4.1">PHP 8.4.1 is now a tagged release</a> on PHP's GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Compiled binaries and container images are available for:</p>

            <link href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/"/>
            <updated>2024-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're thrilled to introduce the pre-release of the PHP Installer for Extensions (PIE) ‚Äì <a href="https://github.com/php/pie"><strong>github.com/php/pie</strong></a>!</p>

<p>PIE aims to simplify managing PHP extensions by providing a modern, flexible alternative to PECL and treating extensions as first-class citizens in the PHP ecosystem.</p>

<blockquote>
PIE development is commissioned by the <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/tech/php"><strong>Sovereign Tech Agency</strong></a>.
</blockquote>

<p>This initial pre-release is available as a <a href="https://github.com/php/pie/releases/tag/0.2.0">PHAR download</a>, and we invite you to take it for a spin and share your feedback. While this release is an exciting milestone, we know there's a lot more work ahead to make PIE ready for widespread use, so your feedback is invaluable. If you encounter any issues, or have any questions, feel free to open an <a href="https://github.com/php/pie/issues">issue on GitHub</a>, and help us shape the future of PIE.</p>

<h2 id="why-pie%3F">Why PIE?</h2>

<p>With PIE, the process of managing PHP extensions becomes more streamlined. Extensions are distributed via <a href="https://packagist.org/extensions">Packagist</a> just like regular PHP packages! It makes the installation and update process quite familiar if you already use Composer.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre working to make PIE stronger and easier to use. We‚Äôre improving how PHP extensions are managed and using ideas from Composer to make the process smoother.</p>

            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/01/how-hooks-happened/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PHP 8.4 is coming on 21 November this year.  It includes a host of new functionality, but the biggest, in more ways than one, is Property hooks.  Given the excitement around it, as well as its size, the PHP Foundation's Roman Pronsky asked me to write up a bit about the process we went through to produce this beast.</p>

<p>What eventually became the twin RFCs of Property Hooks and Asymmetric Visibility is actually a very old discussion.  We'll look back at the decade-plus saga that got us here, how Ilija Tovilo and I got sucked in, how the design came to be, and how we managed to get it across the finish line.  Here's a teaser: It would not have happened without the PHP Foundation.</p>

<h2 id="ancient-history">Ancient history</h2>

<p>Ilija and I were not the first RFC to propose "property accessors," as they're called in most languages.  In fact, our RFC was the fifth:</p>

<ol>
<li>2009: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/propertygetsetsyntax">Property get/set syntax</a> by Dennis Robinson.  The core concepts and arguments behind it are all there, and haven't really changed in 15 years.  It never went to a vote.</li>
<li>2012: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/propertygetsetsyntax-v1.2">Property get/set syntax v1.2</a> by Clint Priest and Nikita Popov.  It didn't pass the 2/3 threshold for a vote, but did pass 50%.</li>
<li>2013: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/propertygetsetsyntax-alternative-typehinting-syntax">Property get/set syntax alternate typehinting syntax</a>, by Nikita Popov.  An alternate approach that proved very unpopular, failing 3 to 12.  However, it included a shorthand syntax that looks suspiciously like what eventually became property types.</li>
<li>2021: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property_accessors">Property Accessors</a> by Nikita Popov. More of a brainstorm of what property accessors could be, including specific use-case options like <code>lazy</code> or <code>guard</code>.  It never went to a vote, but Nikita did note that "We could likely get 80% of the value of accessors by supporting read-only properties and 90% by also supporting private-write properties."  (I don't fully agree, but much of the value is in private-write.)</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these attempts had a few things in common:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pseudo-functions that live on properties and intercept get/set operations.</li>
<li>Asymmetric visibility</li>
<li>Interface properties</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-new-team-enters-the-arena">A new team enters the arena</h2>

<p>Fast forward to the summer of 2022.  Ilija Tovilo decided he wanted to take a swing at accessors next, and approached me for help.  Ilija and I had already worked together on the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/enumerations">Enums RFC</a>, so we knew we worked well together.  In part, that's because we have very different skill sets.  Ilija is rapidly becoming one of the most PHP engine-knowledgeable people around and quite proficient at writing C code, but is, by his own admission, not the most proficient writer of English.  I am a weirdo who enjoys language research, designing away edge cases, and can type fast enough to keep up with the Internals mailing list.  We complement each other well.</p>

<p>Illija is also fully funded by the PHP Foundation to work on the engine, without which this amount of work would have been impossible.  I work on a volunteer basis, and as my employers allow.</p>

<p>(Side note: As of this writing, I am between jobs.  If you're looking for a highly-experienced PHP Staff/Principal Engineer with experience in design, architecture, and leading teams, please <a href="https://github.com/Crell/">reach out</a> and let's talk!)</p>

<h2 id="research%2C-then-development">Research, then development</h2>

<p>With the initial goal of "making Nikita's proposal work-ish," I started digging into the research and design side.  My <a href="https://github.com/Crell/php-rfcs/blob/master/property-hooks/research.md">initial brainstorming</a> shows where our thoughts were at the time.  In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are two models of accessors: In untyped languages without visibility controls&mdash;like JavaScript and Python&mdash;accessors are methods with funny syntax.  In typed languages with visibility controls&mdash;like C#, Swift, and Kotlin&mdash;accessors are enhancements to a defined property.  As PHP is, let's face it, a typed language with visibility controls, that was clearly the model to follow (as had all previous RFCs).</li>
<li>Yes, we really would need asymmetric visibility, accessors, and interface properties.  While technically separate features, they make the most sense in combination.</li>
<li>The whole scope would be huge, so we needed to break it up where we could.  Splitting Asymmetric visibility off to its own RFC was the most natural place, which would be made easier by using Swift's <code>private(set)</code> style syntax.</li>
</ul>

<p>So in August of 2022 we put forward the first <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/asymmetric-visibility">asymmetric visibility</a> RFC.  Given there was already a clear appetite for such functionality based on list discussions and on the recent <code>readonly</code> addition, which Nikita explicitly intended as a "junior asymmetric visibility," we expected some bikeshedding but overall a straightforward process.</p>

<p>Boy were we wrong.</p>

<h2 id="asymmetric-support">Asymmetric support</h2>

<p>The Asymmetric Visibility RFC was far more contentious than we expected. Some people hated the idea.  Some wouldn't accept anything but the C#-style syntax.  We ran a poll of various different approaches, and our initial proposal (Swift-style placement and syntax) ended up winning by a slim margin, but disappointingly "the consensus position isn't your position, sorry" didn't really persuade anyone.</p>

<p>Eventually, Asymmetric visibility finally went down in a 14:12 vote in January of 2023.  RFCs need 2/3 majorities to pass, so 14:12, while a simple majority, isn't enough.</p>

<h2 id="hooking-it-up">Hooking it up</h2>

<p>The failure of asymmetric visibility was a blow to both of us.  In most cases we didn't even know why the people who voted "no" did so, which made addressing their concerns guesswork.  Had we just wasted our time?  Would accessors even be acceptable?  The current RFC process is very bad at providing that kind of actionable feedback.</p>

<p>While no one from the Foundation mentioned it, we were also both acutely aware that Ilija had been working on paid time for a proposal that ended up failing.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we had split the RFC in two deliberately so that even if only one was successful there was still a benefit.  We therefore turned our attention to the accessor part of the proposal (which included interface properties) and continued working.</p>

<p>The model we developed was essentially a "direct port from Swift, with a few slight renames."</p>

<p>The initial design included:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>get</code> - Totally takes over reading, and there's no physical property created.</li>
<li><code>set</code> - Totally takes over writing, and there's no physical property created.</li>
<li><code>beforeSet</code> - Intercepts the writing of a property but doesn't change the actual write itself.</li>
<li><code>afterSet</code> - Called after the property is written, doesn't change the actual write itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is also when we changed the name from "accessors" to "hooks," which seemed a more accurate description given that model.  This later ended up not making sense, but Ilija had already taken the time to rename everything in the patch, so it was too much work to change back.  Sorry.</p>

<p>The RFC text itself grew and grew.  PHP is a very mature (read: complex) language, and so there were lots of nooks and crannies that we had to account for.  Properties touch on almost everything: References, arrays, inheritance, final properties, interfaces, interaction with <code>readonly</code>, interaction with <code>__get</code>/<code>__set</code>, serialization, constructor property promotion, reflection...</p>

<p>PHP is a big language, and we needed to think through and implement every possible edge case to avoid booby traps.</p>

<h2 id="some-very-good-advice">Some very good Advice</h2>

<p>We finally had a working design and implementation by April 2023 or so, but were quite nervous about it.  It was big, and we were both still smarting from the loss of asymmetric visibility.  Roman suggested that he run it past the PHP Foundation's Advisory Board for feedback first before going to the list, which turned out to be the best thing we could do.</p>

<p>The Board came back with mostly positive feedback; they liked the concept, the design, the detail... but having 4 separate hooks felt very clumsy to them.  Especially with get/set wiping the backing property entirely and leaving the developer on their own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The PHP Foundation's Advisory Board</strong> serves as a vital bridge between our major sponsors and the PHP development community. It's a Slack channel where we share early updates, insights, and ask for feedback. As well as receive insights and queries from sponsors' representatives. <br><br>

Companies interested in joining this influential group and directly contributing to the future of PHP can become members of the Advisory Board by contributing a minimum of $12,000 to The&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;Foundation as at least a Silver Sponsor. <br/><br/>

<strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/">Learn more about sponsorship opportunities.</a></strong><br/>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't have the original chat log, but that resulted in a brief exchange that went approximately like this:</p>

<pre><code class="text">Roman: The Advisory Board says three different set-ish hooks are a problem  
Larry: Well, we kinda have to, because you can't access a property 
       from within its own hook, that doesn't make sense.  
Ilija: Er, actually we could do that easily.  
Larry: Wait, what?  That... how... why...  
Larry: *does some research*  
Larry: Well crap, that's exactly what Kotlin does.  
       Why didn't we research Kotlin in the first place?  
Ilija: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
Ilija: Well, I just switched it over to that. Looks nicer.
</code></pre>

<p>And so there we were, with half as many syntaxes for the same functionality, and a feature name (hooks) that no longer made sense.  Oh well.</p>

<p>We finally made a public proposal at the start of May 2023.  Initial feedback was quite positive, though there was some pushback, including around the syntax from people who wanted the Javascript/Python style (naturally).  And the length.  Oh, the length.  If hooks isn't the longest RFC ever proposed, it's close.  But as we reiterated many times, that's because the problem space itself is highly complex.</p>

<p>Sadly, time was not on our side.  Ilija was still working out some implementation edge cases and PHP 8.3‚Äôs feature-freeze was rapidly approaching.  So in early July, almost exactly a year after we started working on it, we decided to postpone hooks until 8.4 to give such a large change enough time to settle in and get adjusted if needed.</p>

<h2 id="take-2">Take 2</h2>

<p>After many distractions, we were able to bring the topic back up in <a href="https://externals.io/message/122445">February of 2024</a>, with the intent to bring it to a vote quickly, in March.  (We were so naive.)</p>

<p>There was a lot more discussion this time around, though a lot of it was re-hashing edge cases we'd already addressed.  We also spent a considerable amount of time talking with the Foundation's developer team.  They, by and large, represent the most experienced developers of PHP Internals today, and were an invaluable resource.  That we could talk to them in real time via the Foundation's private chat also helped, as that's a far easier way to handle back-and-forth than a mailing list.</p>

<p>There were a few significant changes we did end up making in response to feedback, from both the list and the Foundation team.  Most importantly, Ilija managed to make array properties work, which had been a challenge due to references.  Once again, being able to attack the problem from two directions (design and ergonomics from me, implementation from Ilija) let us improve the overall experience dramatically.</p>

<h2 id="down-to-the-wire">Down to the wire</h2>

<p>Even then, with all the positive feedback, it wasn't clear to us if it would pass.  Many people on the list had expressed support, but a lot of them were non-voters.</p>

<p>Others had expressed essentially "fearful support"; They liked the idea, couldn't find fault with the implementation, but were concerned about just how big and complex the feature was.</p>

<p>Still others, for various reasons, suggested moving certain sub-features to a separate, future RFC. Which is often code for "I don't like this part, but I don't want to vote against the RFC because of it, so please let me vote against it separately."  We explained, repeatedly, that this was already the slimmed down, partial version.  The other part was asymmetric visibility.</p>

<p>After a lot of discussion and with a lot of trepidation, we called the vote in mid-April of 2024.  It passed 42:2.  I don't understand PHP Internals at times.</p>

<h2 id="asymmetric-visibility-2%3A-the-wrath-of-ilija">Asymmetric Visibility 2: The Wrath of Ilija</h2>

<p>Several people pointed out that hooks without asymmetric visibility had significant holes in it.  They were right, which is why we'd originally proposed that first.  We had decided that if hooks pass, we would take a second swing at asymmetric visibility.  So we did.</p>

<p>The only actionable feedback we'd gotten the first time around was that without support for combining <code>readonly</code> and asymmetric visibility, the RFC felt "incomplete."  We went through a few variations on how to address that before landing on the final solution: Change <code>readonly</code> from being implicitly <code>private(set)</code> to implicitly <code>protected(set)</code>.  Otherwise, the discussion was mostly a retread of the year before.</p>

<p>We were still stressing out about this one, too.  It hadn't passed before, why would it now?  However, this time it passed 24:7 at the start of August 2024.</p>

<p>Looking at the results, while there were two people who changed from a No to a Yes, the biggest change from the first vote was simply who voted.  Most of the previous No votes... didn't vote this time.  But entirely new people showed up to vote yes.  Showing up to vote matters, folks.</p>

<h2 id="on-to-the-next-adventure">On to the next adventure</h2>

<p>25 months after the process started, PHP now joins the cadre of languages with robust, flexible properties that can do more than just hold dumb values.  It's been a wild ride, and at many points a needlessly stressful one.  The end result, though, is a host of powerful new features that make PHP 8.4 the most exciting PHP release in several years.  Really, they're the best thing since enums...</p>

<p>I hope this tale is a useful insight for folks into how the sausage is made.  Now go enjoy interface properties, hooks, and asymmetric visibility.  Or enjoy not using hooks, but having the option to, which eliminates a lot of code.  Both work.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Web Services Tool (WST) is a command-line application developed to test PHP-FPM, <a href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/php"><strong>commissioned by the Sovereign Tech Fund</strong></a> (STF). Its primary goal is to facilitate testing of the integration between different web servers and PHP-FPM across various environments and configurations.</p>

<p>This blog post provides an introduction to the tool. We'll go through the history of PHP-FPM testing and the reasons that led to WST's development. The post also outlines the project structure, insights into the tool‚Äôs architecture, its current state, and the roadmap for future development.</p>

<h2 id="php-fpm-testing-and-wst-history">PHP-FPM testing and WST history</h2>

<h3 id="first-steps">First steps</h3>

<p>PHP-FPM was initially developed as a patch series starting around 2004. It evolved into a more modular architecture with a separate SAPI by 2009, and it was <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/06b9943842eb954025ac83b542e97d6310aa524a">merged into the PHP core</a> in 2010. It was declared stable with the release of PHP 5.4 in 2011. While this version introduced many features that are still used today, it did not include any automated tests; all testing was done manually.</p>

<p>The first automated test was introduced in early 2014, and it provided a basic check to verify that PHP-FPM can start with a certain configuration. Later that year, more advanced tests were added, including a FastCGI client, which allowed PHP-FPM to run in a separate process, accept FastCGI requests, and return responses. This was a major step forward, as it enabled testing scenarios that weren't previously possible. However, the implementation was more of a workaround, piecing together different components. The tests were repetitive and limited in their ability to define complex expectations.</p>

<h3 id="a-bit-more%2C-but-still-not-enough">A bit more, but still not enough</h3>

<p>In 2018, I <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/ea592e6b6c43b7c5ebedf63254b8088f741e276c">carried out</a> a complete rewrite of the FPM tests, introducing a primary <code>Tester</code> class. This class integrated more robust expectations and added abstractions for handling requests and responses. Over the years, this framework has been improved and now includes many features that support testing more complex scenarios. It significantly improves test code re-usability and offers various new options for easier testing. However, it <strong>doesn‚Äôt cover integration tests with web servers</strong>, which often have quirks not easily caught by these tests. Additionally, this framework <strong>doesn't handle high-load scenarios</strong>, which are necessary for testing process management in PHP-FPM. <strong>This showed the need for a new tool to keep PHP-FPM development safe.</strong></p>

<h3 id="here-comes-the-php-foundation-and-the-stf-service-agreement">Here comes The PHP Foundation and the STF service agreement</h3>

<p>Initially, I had an idea to extend <a href="https://github.com/bukka/fpmt">fpmt</a>, my tool for testing PHP-FPM (specifically for sending custom FastCGI requests), and integrate most of the testing logic directly into it. However, it soon became clear that maintaining such a tool would require constant code changes, and the effort needed to build and sustain it was too large. As a result, I put the project on hold.</p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt until 2023 that the idea resurfaced, thanks to an opportunity provided by the Sovereign Tech Fund. The STF gave PHP projects a chance to propose initiatives aimed at improving their overall health. Testing, being a critical component of project health, made this tool a perfect candidate, and it, along with <a href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/php#what-are-we-funding">three other projects</a>, comprised the scope of work commissioned by the STF.</p>

<h3 id="how-wst-started">How WST started</h3>

<p>I began the work on the tool in January 2024 with the planning phase. It quickly became evident that a more generic approach would offer greater flexibility and cover more use cases. I decided to design the tool around a clear configuration structure, which would be parsed and executed. A key part of the planning was ensuring that the <strong>same tests could run both locally and in containers</strong>, with an option to simulate high loads by integrating with a load testing tool. Given these requirements, I chose Go as the implementation language, as it provides well-supported clients and packages for all the project‚Äôs needs. Go's advanced templating capabilities, which are popular in tools like Helm, were also a deciding factor.</p>

<p>For easier setup, the project was organized under a new <a href="https://github.com/wstool/"><strong>wstool</strong></a> organization, containing two repositories: one for the actual tool implementation (<a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst">wst</a>) and another for the PHP-FPM testing configurations (<a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst-php-fpm">wst-php-fpm</a>). The structure of the application differs slightly from typical Go applications, as it focuses on achieving full test coverage for most components. As a result, it features multiple sub-packages to allow for the creation of mocks using <a href="https://github.com/vektra/mockery">Go Mockery</a>, which generates <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">Testify</a> mocks.</p>

<h2 id="the-current-state-and-its-structure">The current state and its structure</h2>

<p>The tool has been developed into a functional state that allows it to run various tests. Its architecture is defined by its configuration, with a strong emphasis on flexibility.</p>

<p>At the core of the configuration is a file that contains a specification composed of settings for various components. Multiple configuration files can be specified, along with specific overrides for selected values. These configurations and overrides are then merged into a single, unified configuration. Example of execution could look like:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">wst -f /path/to/cfg1 -f /path/to/cfg2 -o spec.defaults.service.sandbox=docker
</code></pre>

<p>This will merge cfg1 and cfg2 and apply overwrite for the default server.<br />
The final configuration defines environments, sandboxes, servers, and instances ‚Äì these are the core elements of the application‚Äôs execution. Additionally, it defines some default settings, including base parameters. These parameters allow for further customization and can be accessed within template files and strings. The example of primary configuration looks like</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">version: "0.1"
name: FPM
description: FPM server specifications for testing PHP-FPM
spec:
  environments: environments.yaml
  instances: spec/instances/*.yaml
  sandboxes: sandboxes.yaml
  servers: servers/*/*/server.yaml
  workspace: workspace/
  defaults:
    service:
      sandbox: local
    parameters:
      fpm_binary: php-fpm
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it is possible to separate config to multiple files that can be specified in the wildcard format. The meaning of primary spec parts is following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environments</strong> specify where the tests are executed, allowing for tests to run locally, in Docker, or Kubernetes environments. This enables testing across different distributions using Docker and under production-like loads with Kubernetes. Such flexibility helps recreate reported issues more effectively, as some problems only appear under heavy load. It also provides greater confidence when implementing new features or fixing complex bugs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sandboxes</strong> are closely related to environments, defining how services behave in each environment. Specifically, they define hooks containing commands or signals for starting, stopping, reloading, and restarting services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Servers</strong> contain the specifications of the web servers or other web services being tested. They define server configuration templates, expectations, parameters, and specific hooks linked to sandboxes. For instance, a server might specify PHP-FPM configuration files (fpm.conf, php.ini), set up start hooks for the PHP-FPM binary with selected parameters, and outline specific log message expectations following PHP-FPM startup. These predefined settings help reduce code duplication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instances</strong> are the core of WST‚Äôs testing functionality. They define everything specific to a single test case, primarily specifying the service. This means choosing the server by name, providing parameters, and specifying configuration files to be included with the selected parameters. They also define scripts included in the services and their content, which are then utilized during actions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The mentioned actions offer additional flexibility by providing a custom mini pipeline which offers a high degree of flexibility. Actions are responsible for controlling services (start, stop, restart, reload), triggering requests (request, bench), and setting expectations on output (logs), responses (for requests), and metrics (for benchmarks). There is also a parallel action, allowing multiple actions to run simultaneously</p>

<p>This is an example of a simple instance with actions:</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">version: "0.1"
name: FPM
description: FPM server specifications for testing PHP-FPM
spec:
  environments: environments.yaml
  instances: spec/instances/*.yaml
  sandboxes: sandboxes.yaml
  servers: servers/*/*/server.yaml
  workspace: workspace/
  defaults:
    service:
      sandbox: local
    parameters:
      fpm_binary: php-fpm
</code></pre>

<p>This test starts FPM and <code>httpd</code> with selected configs, sends a request for <code>index.php</code> path, verifies that response body and stops the servers.</p>

<p>Currently, the tool works in a local environment and has already helped recreate complex scoreboard locking issues through its automated load testing (bench action). The Docker and Kubernetes environments have largely been finalized in terms of structure, with most of the implementation in place. However, some additional changes and fixes are needed for full functionality.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-results">The first results</h2>

<p>The initial PHP-FPM configuration includes only a few instances and server configurations. It defines three servers‚Äîfpm, nginx, and httpd (Apache). These servers contain default configurations with all necessary settings, as well as variants for Debian and RedHat that could be used as needed. The servers also define reusable expectations across instances. For PHP-FPM, these expectations are used to verify that the server has started successfully, based on log messages, and include templates for asserting FPM status responses.</p>

<p>As for instances, there are currently the following tests defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst-php-fpm/blob/bccec57f02e7918aedf5bce43387a3c1ce733f37/spec/instances/access-suppress-path-status.yaml">Access log path suppression test</a> &#45; It verifies access logs, which uses status checking and output verification to ensure that access logs are properly generated in both PHP-FPM and Nginx.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst-php-fpm/blob/bccec57f02e7918aedf5bce43387a3c1ce733f37/spec/instances/httpd-proxy-fcgi-handler-basic.yaml">Apache httpd mod&#95;proxy&#95;fcgi SetHandler basic tests</a> &#45; It tests FastCGI integration between Apache httpd and PHP-FPM and makes sure that different combinations of test works. It also recreates a recent issue with Apache httpd integration.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst-php-fpm/blob/bccec57f02e7918aedf5bce43387a3c1ce733f37/spec/instances/scoreboard-atomic-copy.yaml">Scoreboard atomic copying test</a> &#45; It focuses on testing the scoreboard under higher loads. This test has been particularly useful in reliably reproducing a scoreboard locking issue, which has been causing errors for users. Once the issue is resolved, the test will serve as a regression check to ensure the problem doesn‚Äôt reoccur.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-future-development">The future development</h2>

<p>The primary goal moving forward is to add more tests and begin using the tool to address existing complex issues and features in PHP-FPM. This will require further updates to the application to improve its capabilities. The tool also needs to be stabilized and made more user-friendly, specifically, enhancing logging and documentation.</p>

<p>Once the tool and PHP-FPM tests reach a stable state, the next step would be to set up a continuous integration (CI) system to run all stable tests regularly against the latest repository. Ideally, this could be integrated into PHP‚Äôs nightly workflow. There is a possibility to use higher spec resources from TeamCity or infrastructure provided by AWS to PHP Foundation which is currently used for benchmarking project testing performance of PHP.</p>

<p>Since the tool is not specific to PHP-FPM, it could also be applied to other parts of PHP. For example, it could finally enable tests for the Apache handler (<code>mod_php</code>) SAPI, which is still widely used but currently lacks testing, making changes risky. Additionally, the tool could be useful for testing specific scenarios involving PHP extensions that rely on external services, such as databases or LDAP.</p>

<p>Another area where the tool could be valuable is in performing various security-related tests. Adding fuzzing capabilities could help uncover a range of issues, including potential security vulnerabilities, not only in PHP-FPM but also in the web servers themselves.</p>

<p>Testing full framework applications and automating setup steps like <code>composer install</code> could improve the tool as well. This will require more time and help from the community to make sure the setups are reliable in all environments.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The WST has already proven to be valuable for PHP-FPM development and testing, because it helps address  complex issues which were never tested in automated way before.</p>

<p>As more features and tests are added, its importance will only grow. We hope it will become an essential part of ensuring PHP-FPM's stability, performance, and evolution.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The PHP Foundation is proud to announce our support for the Open Source Pledge initiative, launched by Sentry and its partners. This step addresses the sustainability challenges within the Open Source Software (OSS) community, particularly affecting PHP and its ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="the-open-source-pledge%3A-a-commitment-to-sustainability">The Open Source Pledge: A Commitment to Sustainability</h2>

<p>The Open Source Pledge represents a commitment from member companies to provide meaningful financial support to Open Source maintainers. This initiative aims to prevent maintainer burnout and reduce the risk of high-profile security incidents that can impact the broader tech ecosystem.</p>

<p>The OSS community, including PHP, faces significant challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Security risks:</strong> High-profile incidents like Log4shell, XZ, and Heartbleed have highlighted the potential consequences of under-resourced projects.</li>
<li><strong>Developer burnout:</strong> Many maintainers, often volunteers, are feeling exhausted and leaving the very projects you might be using.</li>
<li><strong>Losing maintainers:</strong> The demanding nature of maintaining open-source software means we‚Äôre seeing fewer contributors over time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation%27s-role">The PHP Foundation's Role</h2>

<p>As the main funder and steward of the PHP language, we‚Äôve seen firsthand how a lack of funding impacts crucial projects. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core language development:</strong> Keeping PHP up to date and improving it takes a lot of time and expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Security support:</strong> Without enough funding, PHP can‚Äôt address vulnerabilities quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Extension maintenance:</strong> Many essential PHP extensions are struggling to find people to maintain them.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation efforts:</strong> Keeping PHP‚Äôs extensive documentation current is always a big challenge.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-join-the-pledge">How to Join the Pledge</h1>

<p>The Open Source Pledge offers a structured approach to supporting OSS with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimum contribution: $2,000 per year, per developer on staff.</li>
<li>Transparency: Companies should publish annual reports detailing their payments.</li>
<li>Direct impact: Funds go directly to maintainers, supporting their crucial work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to supporting the PHP Foundation, our major sponsors <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> and <a href="https://tideways.com/">Tideways</a> are already part of the <a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/">Open Source Pledge</a>.</p>

<h1 id="%5Caction-required%5C-join-the-pledge%5C%21">&#91;Action Required&#93; Join the Pledge&#33;</h1>

<p>We urge PHP-based companies, developers, and organizations to join the Open Source Pledge and <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/">sponsor The PHP Foundation</a></strong>.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to the PHP Core Roundup series, we cover what's new and changing in PHP and provide an update on the recent proposals to change and discussions around them.</p>

<p>Our last update was almost a year ago, and that was because we felt the PHP Core Roundup posts were getting stale and our previous format was repetitive and had a lot of changes that made the posts excessively long.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-php-core-roundup-series">The New PHP Core Roundup Series</h2>

<p>Today, we are trying a new format that we got rid of text that looked like a mere changelog, to a post highlighting the general momentum of PHP development. This also means we might not get to celebrate and mention all the contributions from the PHP Foundation members and the other contributors as we did in previous posts.</p>

<p>Maintaining a mature, reliable, and widely used programming language that continues to get new features and improvements for almost 30 years involves a lot of work! Maintaining PHP documentation, php.net infrastructure, translations, triaging issues and security reports, bug fixes, mailing lists, reviewing RFCs, and packaging PHP only to name a few, we have PHP contributors and PHP Foundation members putting a commendable amount of effort into improving PHP!</p>

<p>While these PHP Core Roundup series may not write about these contributions often because we want to keep these posts exciting and resourceful, we want to spread love to all the contributors to the PHP ecosystem üíú.</p>

<h2 id="php-release-cycle-updates">PHP Release Cycle Updates</h2>

<p>In April, we voted and accepted an <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/release_cycle_update">RFC</a> to update our Release Cycle policy.</p>

<p>The PHP Core team provided two years of active support, followed by only one year of security fixes. We now have a new release cycle that, from PHP 8.1 (released in 2021 November), all PHP versions now get <strong>two years of security fixes instead of one year</strong>. The two-year active support period remains the same.</p>

<p>Further, we have changed the active-support and End-Of-Life dates to align to December 31st of the calendar year. This makes the support and EOL dates more predictable.</p>

<p>Here are the updated active-support and EOL dates for the current line-up of PHP versions. Dates changed from the previously set dates are in bold.</p>

<h2 id="php-core-developments">PHP Core Developments</h2>

<p>A few days ago, PHP 8.4 reached its feature-freeze. PHP 8.4 is slated to be released on November 21st of this year.</p>

<p>The first release candidate for PHP 8.4 is already out ‚Äî they are not production-ready, but they are available to try out and test PHP application on, either by compiling from <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/tags">source</a>, using <a href="https://windows.php.net/qa/">Windows binaries</a>, or in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags?name=8.4-">Docker containers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="highlights-for-php-8.4">Highlights for PHP 8.4</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 is an important release that brings major new features, several updates to the build dependencies and underlying libraries, and a fair bit of deprecations to iron out some of the legacy and undesirable behaviors and features in legacy PHP versions.</p>

<p>Using various approaches, each PHP version brings a lot of performance improvements and security tightening too. In PHP 8.4, we continue this in this direction with several minor internal improvements as well as noticeable improvements in JIT, and PHP extensions such as mbstring, BCMath, XML extensions, PCRE, and more.</p>

<p>Further, PHP 8.4 unbundles IMAP, Pspell, OCI, and pdo_oci extensions. It means if you wanted to continue using them, you'll have to install via PECL.</p>

<h3 id="property-hooks-and-asymmetric-visibility">Property Hooks and Asymmetric Visibility</h3>

<p>One of the most important features in PHP 8.4 is that you can now use <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">property hooks</a> and declare property <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/asymmetric-visibility-v2">visibility separately</a> for get and set operations. Both of these features are thanks to the collaborative efforts of Ilija Tovilo and Larry Garfield. Ilija, funded by the foundation üíú, focused on the implementation. Meanwhile, Larry, a frequent contributor, worked on the specification and authored the RFC text.
Property hooks allow declaring virtual properties with "hooks" that get executed when the properties are accessed or set, and the hooks get called with the object in context, to run their own logic.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {
    public string $emailAddress {
        set {
            if (!filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
                throw new ValueError('emailAddress property must be a valid email address');
            }
            $this-&gt;emailAddress = $value;
        }
    }
}

$user = new User();
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'test@example.com'; // Allowed
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'not an email address'; // Throws ValueError
</code></pre>

<p>Property hooks open up a vast possibilities to leading to less boilerplate code, improve readability, and make PHP classes and their APIs more intuitive.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property Hooks RFC</a> is perhaps our longest RFC ever, detailing use cases and syntax such as short functions, using them in constructor-promoted class properties, how a subclass can override or call parent property hooks, how they work with other mechanics such as readonly, magic methods, references, arrays, etc.</p>

<p>We will be covering more about details and mechaniscs of Property Hooks soon in future posts.</p>

<h3 id="asymmetric-visibility">Asymmetric Visibility</h3>

<p>Another useful feature added in PHP 8.4 is the ability to set different visibility scopes for get and set operations. This comes in situations where exposing a class property to be <em>read</em> is desired, but not to <em>write</em>.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {
    public private(set) int $userId;

    public function __construct() {
        $this-&gt;userId = 42; // e.g. set from a database value
    }
}

$user = new User();
echo $user-&gt;userId; // 42

$user-&gt;userId = 16; // Not allowed
// Error: Cannot modify private(set) property User::$userId from global scope
</code></pre>

<h3 id="improved-html5-parser">Improved HTML5 Parser</h3>

<p>The DOM Extension in PHP 8.4 received a massive feature-update as well. Previously, the DOM extension only offered libxml2 to parse HTML, which has not kept up with HTML5. The DOM extension now offers new <code>Dom\HTMLDocument</code> and <code>Dom\XMLDocument</code> classes with the former supporting HTML5-compliant parsing support.</p>

<p>There are lots of new improvements in this space, including not only the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/domdocument_html5_parser">HTML5 parsing support</a>, but also <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/opt_in_dom_spec_compliance">DOM spec compliance</a> and several small <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dom_additions_84">additions</a> including adding support for CSS selectors.</p>

<h3 id="bcmath-extension-getting-%60number%60-class-and-new-functions">BCMath extension getting <code>Number</code> class and new functions</h3>

<p>The BCMath extension in PHP 8.4 now has classes with support for operator overloading support!</p>

<pre><code class="php">use BcMath\Number;

$num1 = new Number('22');  
$num2 = new Number('7'); 
$num3 = new Number('100');

$result = ($num1 / $num2) + $num1 - $num2;
echo $result; // 18.1428571428
</code></pre>

<p>Now, instead of using BCMath functions such as <code>bcadd</code>, <code>bcsub</code>, <code>bcdiv</code>, etc, you can now simply use standard operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>, etc.).</p>

<p>The new <code>BcMath\Number</code> class supports operator overloading, which cannot be done by userland PHP classes yet, but the BCMath extension implements it, so you can use them as if they were regular numbers.</p>

<p>The <code>BcMath\Number</code> class implements <code>Stringable</code> interface, so the objects can be used where a string is expected (like how the example above uses it with an <code>echo</code> call). Further, the class implements all <code>bc*</code> functions. For example, it's also possible to call <code>$num-&gt;add($num2)</code> or <code>$num-&gt;add('5')</code> and it returns a new <code>BcMath\Number</code> object without modifying the original object, which makes them immutable.</p>

<p>This comes from Saki Takamachi üíú, one of our new PHP Foundation members. She also made several new improvements including adding new <code>bcfloor</code>, <code>bcceil</code>, <code>bcround</code>, and <code>bcdivmod</code> functions.</p>

<h3 id="...-and-more%21">... and more!</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 is shaping up to be an impactful version, with features such as property hooks and asymmetric visibility we mentioned above, and a healthy amount of deprecations including deprecating <a href="https://php.watch/versions/8.4/implicitly-marking-parameter-type-nullable-deprecated">implicitly nullable parameter declarations</a>.</p>

<p>Further, PHP 8.4 will be released after some popular Linux distro versions in server space reach their EOL date (such as Ubuntu 18.04 and RHEL/CentOS 7), so we took this opportunity to bump the minimum required dependency versions for Curl (>= 7.61.0), OpenSSL (>= 1.1.1). The PHP 8.4 mbstring extension is also updated to with the latest Unicode Character Database version 16 data.</p>

<p>See the lengthy <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.4/UPGRADING"><code>UPGRADING</code></a> file for a complete list of changes, but we will also be covering the important ones in the upcoming PHP Core Roundup posts.</p>

<h2 id="what%27s-in-the-making">What's in the making</h2>

<p>On September 30th, PHP 8.4 reached its feature-freeze, which means PHP 8.4 syntax and features are now fixed; PHP 8.4 will get ironed out and the first GA release is scheduled for November 21st.</p>

<h3 id="pie-%3A-php-installer-for-extensions">PIE : PHP Installer for Extensions</h3>

<p>PIE is a new initiative to be an eventual replacement for PECL. It's still under development, but it will be able to download, build, and install PIE-compatible extensions.</p>

<h3 id="real-time-benchmarking">Real-time benchmarking</h3>

<p>M√°t√© Kocsis üíú <a href="https://externals.io/message/116323">was</a> working on a real-time fully-automated and reproducible <a href="https://github.com/kocsismate/php-version-benchmarks?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction">benchmark</a> for PHP. It is now active (with daily results available <a href="https://github.com/php/real-time-benchmark-data">here</a>).</p>

<p>Using these test suits, we now have reliable data on the performance improvements or degradation in each PHP version.</p>

            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/09/17/application-form-2025/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The PHP Foundation is a non-profit organization, started in 2021 by Acquia, Automattic, Craft CMS, JetBrains, Laravel, PrestaShop, Private Packagist, Symfony, Tideways, and Zend by Perforce with a mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP language.</p>

<p>The foundation pays <a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/#core_developers">10 developers</a> to work on the language. See what the foundation achieved in 2023 in the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/02/26/transparency-and-impact-report-2023/">Impact and transparency report</a>.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre opening a new round of applications for developer positions. We intend to decide on who we will hire by the end of October. If selected, you would start your work January 1st, 2025&#46;</p>

<p>The application form will be <strong>open until October 10, 2024</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="https://forms.gle/Ji7Vvj1y2bMf9pUz7" class="inline-block py-2 no-underline px-6 !text-white bg-[#7f52ff] rounded-3xl hover:bg-[rgba(127,82,255,.8)]">Apply</a>
</p>

<div class="alert">
    <span class="inline-block font-bold">Note: This is not a job for PHP developers or aspiring PHP developers.</span><br> 
The development of PHP is done in the –° programming language, and requires proficiency in system programming.
</div>

<h2 id="note%3A-team-size-is-unlikely-to-grow">Note: Team size is unlikely to grow</h2>

<p>While we won‚Äôt rule out the possibility of expanding our team, it‚Äôs likely we won‚Äôt pay more than the current number of 10 developers. Mindful of our budget limitations, we may rather consider restructuring or adjusting our team to make space for any outstanding applications that better help us meet our goals.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-requirements%3F">What are the requirements?</h2>

<p>As before, we require previous experience in PHP core development. Ideally you should have all, but at least some of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pull-requests / commits to <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/">php/php-src</a></li>
<li>Experience in writing PHP extensions</li>
<li>Participation in PHP mailing lists</li>
<li>Contributions to other open-source projects</li>
</ul>

<p>This time, however, we have a clearer idea of the tasks that can be engaged in and so the pool of considered candidates will be wider.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-going-to-work-on%3F">What are you going to work on?</h2>

<p>Strategic areas we‚Äôd like you to work on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Web APIs (json, PDO, streams, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list. We encourage you to <strong>provide as detailed a description of what you want to work on as possible</strong>.</p>

<p>Our primary selection criterion is <strong>pragmatism</strong>. We place greater emphasis on solutions that improve the developer experience and benefit businesses that rely on PHP, rather than new syntax features.</p>

<p>Out of scope:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pure documentation work</li>
<li>PHP packages</li>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Translations</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-working-for-the-php-foundation-look-like%3F">What does working for the PHP Foundation look like?</h2>

<p>Working for the PHP Foundation offers a lot of freedom, but it also requires discipline. Your work will roughly consist of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>40% Triaging issues and fixing bugs</li>
<li>30% Working on strategic areas</li>
<li>20% Code reviews</li>
<li>&#62;10% Preparing RFCs and developing new language features</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, developing new RFCs is a fairly small part of the job. Most of the work is typical maintenance of an open source project.</p>

<p>We are a fully distributed team. You can work from any place<strong>&#42;</strong> and at any time. All communication is asynchronous via Slack, GitHub, and Email. We meet for synchronous calls 1-2 times a month.</p>

<p>Your work should be in line with the foundation‚Äôs mission statement, and we expect you to follow <a href="https://thephp.foundation/code-of-conduct/">the code of conduct</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>PHP Foundation Mission Statement</strong></p>
  
  <p>The PHP Foundation is a collective of people and organizations relying on the PHP language. Its mission is to ensure the long-term prosperity of the PHP language.
