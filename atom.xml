            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PHP 8.5, due out November of this year, will bring with it another long-sought-after feature: the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v3">pipe operator</a> (<code>|&gt;</code>).  It's a small feature with huge potential, yet it still took years to happen.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-pipe-operator%3F">What is a pipe operator?</h2>

<p>The pipe operator, spelled <code>|&gt;</code>, is deceptively simple.  It takes the value on its left side and passes it as the single argument to a function (or in PHP's case, <code>callable</code>) on its right side:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$result = "Hello World" |&gt; strlen(...)

// Is equivalent to
$result = strlen("Hello World");
</code></pre>

<p>On its own, that is not all that interesting.  Where it becomes interesting is when it is repeated, or chained, to form a "pipeline."  For example, here's real code from a real project I've worked on, recast to use pipes:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$arr = [
  new Widget(tags: ['a', 'b', 'c']),
  new Widget(tags: ['c', 'd', 'e']),
  new Widget(tags: ['x', 'y', 'a']),
];

$result = $arr
    |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; array_column($x, 'tags') // Gets an array of arrays
    |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; array_merge(...$x)       // Flatten into one big array
    |&gt; array_unique(...)                  // Remove duplicates
    |&gt; array_values(...)                  // Reindex the array.
;

// $result is ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'x', 'y']
</code></pre>

<p>The same code without pipes would require either this horribly ugly nest of evil:</p>

<pre><code class="php">array_values(array_unique(array_merge(...array_column($arr, 'tags'))));
</code></pre>

<p>Or manually creating a temporary variable for each step.  While temp variables are not the worst thing in the world, they are extra mental overhead, and mean that a chain like that cannot be used in a single-expression context, like a <code>match()</code> block.  A pipe chain can.</p>

<p>Anyone who has worked on the Unix/Linux command line will likely recognize the similarity to the shell pipe, <code>|</code>.  That's very deliberate, as it is effectively the same thing: Use the output from the left side as the input on the right side.</p>

<h2 id="where-did-it-come-from%3F">Where did it come from?</h2>

<p>The <code>|&gt;</code> operator appears in many languages, mostly in the functional world.  F# has essentially the exact same operator, as does OCaml.  Elixir has a slightly fancier version (which we considered but ultimately decided against for now).  Numerous PHP libraries exist in the wild that offer similar capability with many extra expensive steps, including my own <a href="https://github.com/Crell/fp/">Crell/fp</a>.</p>

<p>The story for PHP pipes, though, begins with Hack/HHVM, Facebook's PHP fork nee competitive implementation.  Hack included many features beyond what PHP 5 of the day offered; many of them eventually ended up in later PHP versions.  One of its features was a unique spin on a pipe operator.</p>

<p>In 2016, Sara Golemon, long-time PHP contributor and former Open Source lead on the HHVM project, proposed porting <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator">Hack's pipes</a> to PHP directly.  In that RFC, the right side of a pipe wasn't a <code>callable</code> but an expression, and used a magic <code>$$</code> token (lovingly called <code>T_BLING</code>, at least according to yours truly) to inject the left-side result into it.  In that case, the example above would look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$result = $arr
    |&gt; array_column($$, 'tags')
    |&gt; array_merge(...$$)
    |&gt; array_unique($$)
    |&gt; array_values($$)
;
</code></pre>

<p>While powerful, it was also somewhat limiting.  It was very non-standard, unlike any other language.  It also meant a weird, one-off syntax for partially-calling functions that worked only when paired with pipes.</p>

<p>That RFC didn't go as far as a vote.  Nothing much happened for several years, until 2020/2021.  That's when I, fresh off of writing a book on functional programming in PHP that talked about function composition, decided to take a swing at it.  In particular, I partnered with a team to work on <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/partial_function_application">Partial Function Application</a> (PFA) as a separate RFC from a more <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v2">traditional pipe</a>.  The idea was that turning a multi-parameter function (like <code>array_column()</code> above) into the single-parameter function that <code>|&gt;</code> needed was a useful feature on its own, and should be usable elsewhere.  The syntax was a bit different than the Hack version, in order to make it more flexible: <code>some_function(?, 5, ?, 3, ...)</code>, which would take a 5-or-more parameter function and turn it into a 3 parameter function.</p>

<p>Sadly, PFA didn't pass due to some engine complexity issues, and that largely undermined the v2 Pipe RFC, too.  However, we did get a consolation prize out of it: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/first_class_callable_syntax">First Class Callables</a> (the <code>array_values(...)</code> syntax), courtesy Nikita Popov, were by design a "junior", degenerate version of partial function application.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2025, and I was sufficiently bored to take another swing at pipes.  This time with a better implementation with lots of hand-holding from Ilija Tovilo and Arnaud Le Blanc, both part of the PHP Foundation dev team, I was able to get it through.</p>

<p>Third time's the charm.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts">More than the sum of its parts</h2>

<p>Above, we described pipes as "deceptively simple."  The implementation itself is almost trivial; it's just syntax sugar for the temp variable version, effectively.  However, the best features are the ones that can combine with others or be used in novel ways to punch above their weight.</p>

<p>We saw above how a long array manipulation process could now be condensed into a single chained expression.  Now imagine using that in places where only a single expression is allowed, such as a <code>match()</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$string = 'something GoesHERE';

$newString = match ($format) {
    'snake_case' =&gt; $string
        |&gt; splitString(...)
        |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; implode('_', $x)
        |&gt; strtolower(...),
    'lowerCamel' =&gt; $string
        |&gt; splitString(...),
        |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; array_map(ucfirst(...), $x)
        |&gt; fn($x) =&gt; implode('', $x)
        |&gt; lcfirst(...),
    // Other case options here.
};
</code></pre>

<p>Or, consider that the right-side can also be a function call that returns a <code>Closure</code>.  That means with a few functions that return functions:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$profit = [1, 4, 5] 
    |&gt; loadSeveral(...)
    |&gt; filter(isOnSale(...))
    |&gt; map(sellWidget(...))
    |&gt; array_sum(...);
</code></pre>

<p>Which... gives us mostly the same thing as the long-discussed scalar methods!  Only pipes are more flexible as you can use any function on the right-side, not just those that have been blessed by the language designers as methods.</p>

<p>At this point, pipe comes very close to being "extension functions", a feature of Kotlin and C# that allows writing functions that look like methods on an object, but are actually just stand-alone functions.  It's spelled a bit differently (<code>|</code> instead of <code>-</code>), but it's 75% of the way there, for free.</p>

<p>Or take it a step further.  What if some steps in the pipe may return <code>null</code>?  We can, with a single function, "lift" the elements of our chain to handle <code>null</code> values in the same fashion as null-safe methods.</p>

<pre><code class="php">function maybe(\Closure $c): \Closure
{
    return fn(mixed $arg) =&gt; $arg === null ? null : $c($arg);
}

$profit = [1, 4, 5] 
    |&gt; maybe(loadSeveral(...))
    |&gt; maybe(filter(isOnSale(...)))
    |&gt; maybe(map(sellWidget(...)))
    |&gt; maybe(array_sum(...));
</code></pre>

<p>That's right, we just implemented a Maybe Monad with a pipe and a single-line function.</p>

<p>Now, think about that for streams...</p>

<pre><code class="php">fopen('pipes.md', 'rb') // No variable, so it will close automatically when GCed.
    |&gt; decode_rot13(...)
    |&gt; lines_from_charstream(...)
    |&gt; map(str_getcsv(...))
    |&gt; map(Product::create(...))
    |&gt; map($repo-&gt;save(...))
;
</code></pre>

<p>The potential is absolutely huge.  I don't think it's immodest to say that the pipe operator has one of the highest "bangs for the buck" of any feature in recent memory, alongside such niceties as constructor property promotion.  And all thanks to a little syntax sugar.</p>

<h2 id="what-comes-next%3F">What comes next?</h2>

<p>Although pipes are a major milestone, we're not done.  There is active work on not one but two follow-up RFCs.</p>

<p>The first is a second attempt at <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/partial_function_application_v2">Partial Function Application</a>.  This is a larger feature, but with first-class callables already bringing in much of the necessary plumbing, which simplifies the implementation.  With pipes now providing a natural use case, as well as easy optimization points, it's worth a second attempt.  Whether it makes it into PHP 8.5, is delayed to 8.6, or is again rejected is still an open question as of this writing, though I am hopeful.  Major thanks to Arnaud Le Blanc from the PHP Foundation team for picking it up to update the implementation.</p>

<p>The second is a <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/function-composition">function composition operator</a>.  Where pipe executes immediately, function composition creates a new function by sticking two functions end-to-end.  That would mean the streams example above could be further optimized by combining the <code>map()</code> calls:</p>

<pre><code class="php">fopen('pipes.md', 'rb')
    |&gt; decode_rot13(...)
    |&gt; lines_from_charstream(...)
    |&gt; map(str_getcsv(...) + Product::create(...) + $repo-&gt;save(...))
;
</code></pre>

<p>This one is definitely not going to make it into PHP 8.5, but I am hopeful that we'll be able to get it into 8.6.  Stay tuned.</p>

            <link href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/05/15/frankenphp/"/>
            <updated>2025-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/05/15/frankenphp/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://frankenphp.dev">FrankenPHP</a>, a modern high-performance PHP application server created by <a href="https://dunglas.dev">Kévin Dunglas</a> and sponsored by <a href="http://Les-Tilleuls.coop">Les-Tilleuls.coop</a>, is now officially supported by the PHP Foundation. FrankenPHP integrates PHP directly into Go and Caddy, simplifying deployment, improving performance, and reducing costs. It powers real-time features, supports advanced hosting scenarios, and offers a performance-boosting “worker mode” already integrated by Laravel, Symfony, and Yii. The PHP Foundation will actively contribute to FrankenPHP’s development and host its code on the official PHP GitHub, marking a major step toward modernizing the PHP ecosystem while keeping governance with the original maintainers.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2025/2025-05-15-frankenphp.png" alt="FrankenPHP-PHP-Foundation" /></p>

<p>PHP is a programming language used by around 70% of websites and applications, and by key software and frameworks such as <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a>, and <a href="https://symfony.com">Symfony</a>.</p>

<p>FrankenPHP offers a host of new features that allow to:</p>

<ul>
<li>simplify the development of applications written in PHP;</li>
<li>drastically improve performance, while considerably reducing hosting costs (FinOps) and energy consumption (GreenOps);</li>
<li>facilitate deployment in production, whether on bare-metal servers or in cloud-native environments;</li>
<li>easily develop real-time features thanks to native <a href="https://mercure.rocks">Mercure</a> protocol support;</li>
<li>extend PHP apps with Go, C, and C++ programming languages;</li>
<li>support the PHP programming language in any application written in Go (server, proxy, in-house development...).</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, FrankenPHP integrates the official PHP interpreter as a module for Go and <a href="https://caddyserver.com">Caddy</a>, the popular next-generation web server that supports the latest web platform innovations in terms of performance, security, and DevOps: HTTP/3, compression with Zstandard, 103 Early Hints, automatic generation and renewal of HTTPS certificates, Encrypted Client Hello, structured logs, OpenMetrics/Prometheus metrics… Caddy is also co-maintained by Kévin and sponsored by Les-Tilleuls.coop.</p>

<p>Thanks to its innovative architecture, FrankenPHP lets you install a complete PHP environment (interpreter, web server, extensions, etc.) optimized for performance and security, by downloading a standalone statically compiled executable or a Docker image.</p>

<p>FrankenPHP also offers a performance-optimized mode called “worker mode”, which takes advantage of the capabilities of the Go programming language. When this optional mode is used, the PHP application will be able to retain in memory those elements that can be reused to process other HTTP requests instead of being completely reset to process each incoming HTTP request (“share nothing” model). Worker mode is especially useful for frameworks such as Symfony and Laravel that can prevent rebuilding their kernels and services again and again for nothing.</p>

<p>Using this mode requires minimal adaptations to the code of modern PHP applications in line with good programming practice. The Laravel, Symfony and Yii frameworks already offer official integrations of FrankenPHP's worker mode, enabling worker mode to be activated without modifying the application code.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://sylius.com/blog/ecosystem/month-of-sylius-august-2024/#frankenphp">an analysis carried out this summer by Sylius</a>, the publisher of the eponymous e-commerce platform, the use of FrankenPHP's worker mode reduces the software's response times by 80%, while reducing by more than 6 the number of machines required to serve the same number of users.</p>

<p>FrankenPHP is now a reliable, mature solution used in production for an ever-increasing number of projects. The project now has <a href="https://github.com/dunglas/frankenphp">almost 8,000 stars on GitHub</a>, has passed the symbolic 100-contributor mark, and is officially supported by numerous hosting providers, including Upsun, Laravel Cloud, and Clever Cloud.</p>

<p>To get to this point, it was necessary to initiate close collaboration between the development teams of FrankenPHP, the PHP interpreter itself, the Caddy web server, and even the Go programming language.</p>

<p>Today, we're proud to announce that, with the aim of intensifying this collaboration, enabling the project to gain momentum, and modernizing the entire PHP ecosystem, <strong>the FrankenPHP project is now officially supported by the PHP Foundation</strong>.</p>

<p>In concrete terms, FrankenPHP's source code will be transferred to the PHP project's GitHub organization, and the PHP Foundation team will contribute to the maintenance and development of FrankenPHP to ensure its reliability, durability, and compatibility with the latest language innovations.</p>

<p>Part of the FrankenPHP documentation will also be transferred to the PHP website.</p>

<p>The governance of the project remains unchanged, and the current team of maintainers (Kévin Dunglas, Robert Landers, Alexander Stecher) will continue to be in charge of releases, as well as code reviews. They will be actively collaborating with the PHP Foundation team in charge of the language development.</p>

<p>In addition to the support provided by the foundation, Les-Tilleuls.coop will continue to sponsor FrankenPHP (as well as PHP and Caddy) by providing developers and contributing financially.</p>

<p>FrankenPHP is already <a href="https://caddyserver.com/#:~:text=4x%20faster%20PHP%20apps">promoted by Caddy</a> as the official, modern solution for using PHP with this server.<br />
In the future, to simplify the PHP development experience (one-line installation of a complete development environment) and to promote a solution that, for projects requiring it, considerably improves the performance and efficiency of PHP applications, FrankenPHP may be highlighted on the PHP website as one of the ways to use the language (other SAPIs such as PHP-FPM will continue to be fully supported solutions).</p>

<p>To find out more about FrankenPHP and the many new possibilities it offers, take a look at <a href="https://frankenphp.dev">its documentation</a>. To meet the software's authors and find out how it is used in production, don't miss <a href="https://api-platform.com/con/">the API Platform conference</a> (by the same authors as FrankenPHP) taking place on September 18 and 19 in France (Lille).</p>

<li>Development of a threat model tailored to php-src</li>
<li>Manual code reviews</li>
<li>Dynamic testing procedures</li>
<li>Cryptographic assessments</li>
</ul>

<p>The collaboration between Quarkslab’s auditors and PHP maintainers ensured a thorough examination of the codebase.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>⚠️</em><br />
  Due to budget constraints, the recent security audit focused on the most critical components of the PHP source code rather than the entire codebase. Organizations interested in sponsoring a comprehensive audit or additional assessments are encouraged to <a href="&#109;&#x61;i&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x63;&#111;&#x6e;&#x74;&#97;&#x63;t&#64;&#x74;&#104;&#101;&#x70;&#104;&#x70;&#x2e;&#102;&#x6f;&#x75;&#110;&#x64;a&#116;&#x69;&#111;&#110;">contact us</a>!<br />

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>As of early 2025, The PHP Foundation comprises <strong>8 volunteer board members</strong>, <strong>an Executive Director</strong> sponsored by JetBrains, and <strong>10 developers</strong> paid part-time/full-time who contribute significantly to the PHP language and its extensions.</p>

<p>In 2024, The PHP Foundation received <strong>$683,550 in donations and investments</strong> from organizations and individuals.</p>

<p>The foundation’s primary focus in 2024 remained strengthening the maintenance of PHP core, housed in the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a> GitHub repository. This project is the home of the PHP language, where PHP’s interpreter is developed. Everyone who uses PHP benefits in one way or another from the work that is done in this repository.</p>

<p>The 10 part-time and full-time developers contracted by The PHP Foundation were responsible for a substantial portion of the commits and reviews made to the PHP language.</p>

<ul>
<li>Completion of projects funded by the Sovereign Tech Fund</li>
<li>Expansion of the development team</li>
<li>Increased contributions to PHP core</li>
<li>Enhanced community engagement and sponsor relations</li>
</ul>

<p>The foundation <strong>plans to spend up to $900,000 in 2025</strong>, including compensation and fees. We continue to seek additional sponsor contributions to sustain and expand these efforts in the coming years.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-mission">The PHP Foundation Mission</h2>

<h2 id="projects-for-the-sovereign-tech-agency-delivered-successfully">Projects for The Sovereign Tech Agency Delivered Successfully</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/">Sovereign Tech Agency</a> (STA) supports the development, improvement, and maintenance of open digital infrastructure in the public interest. Its goal is to strengthen the open-source ecosystem sustainably, focusing on security, resilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the code. STF is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) and supported by the German Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation GmbH (SPRIND).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2025/report-2024/sta.png" width="597" alt="STA"></p>

<p>The Sovereign Tech Agency commissioned work on four major projects, all of which we successfully delivered. Here’s a brief overview of the results.</p>

<h3 id="pecl-overhaul">PECL Overhaul</h3>

<p>The previous system for distributing PHP extensions, PECL/PEAR, is outdated, clumsy for users, and prone to supply-chain attacks, making it unreliable for average developers. This as a result leads to the creation of redundant tools and multiple security issues.</p>

<p>We proposed to rewrite the PECL installer, replacing the messy code and the inefficient website.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="https://github.com/php/pie"><strong>🥧PIE</strong></a> <strong>(PHP Installer for Extensions)</strong>, a new tool that replaces PECL with a PHP-native toolchain that is easier to maintain and more secure. It relies on the packagist.org infrastructure which is also a native PHP ecosystem.</p>

<p>Follow the progress of <strong>PIE</strong> here: <a href="https://github.com/php/pie">https://github.com/php/pie</a>.</p>

<p>The tool has already gathered a group of <a href="https://github.com/php/pie/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> and was well received in the community:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.codito.dev/2024/11/pie-new-extension-installer-for-php/">Pie: new extension installer for PHP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phpconference.nl/session/pie-the-phps-next-big-thing/">PIE: The PHP’s Next Big Thing</a></li>

<li><a href="https://laravel-news.com/pie">PIE (PHP Installer for Extensions)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We continue investing in PIE in 2025.</p>

<h3 id="web-services-tool-for-php-fpm">Web Services Tool for PHP-FPM</h3>

<p>The Web Services Tool (WST) is a command-line application designed to test PHP-FPM integration across different web servers, environments, and configurations.</p>

<p>Currently, the tool is hosted under a separate GitHub organization (wstool/wst), with plans to move it to the official PHP GitHub organization in the future.</p>

<p>WST has already proven valuable for PHP-FPM development and testing, helping to identify and address complex issues that were previously untested in an automated way.</p>

<p>Learn more in the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/21/web-services-tool-for-php-fpm/">introductory blog post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="security-audit">Security Audit</h3>

<p>We conducted the first external security audit of the PHP core source code in over a decade. The audit is organized in partnership with <a href="https://ostif.org/"><strong>OSTIF</strong></a> and performed by <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/"><strong>Quarkslab</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The public report is currently pending and will be published on <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">The PHP Foundation website</a> once available.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-improvements">Documentation Improvements</h3>

<p>We made multiple incremental improvements to the PHP documentation and also conducted a security review of the docs. Like the source code audit, this review was organized in partnership with <a href="https://ostif.org/"><strong>OSTIF</strong></a> and performed by <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/"><strong>Quarkslab</strong></a>. As the scope here was too huge, we had to be smart and limit the review to certain most impactful pages.</p>

<p>Additionally, a new Wasm-based PHP runner has been included allowing all code example blocks to be executed directly on the page thanks to <a href="https://les-tilleuls.coop/en">Les-Tilleuls.coop</a>. Further improvements have been made since then, by fixing more examples and including resources to make the XML extensions' examples work..</p>

<p>An auto-cleaner script has also been added that removes comments older than 1 year with a score of &#45;5 or lower.  This has removed around 2000 low-quality notes from the site.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-update">Infrastructure Update</h3>

<p>As part of <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/programs/bug-resilience">The Sovereign Tech Bug Resilience Program</a>, we partnered with <a href="https://neighbourhood.ie/">Neighbourhoodie Software</a> to overhaul the scripts powering parts of PHP’s web infrastructure, and also set up more appropriate back-ups.
Previously scattered scripts have been consolidated into robust Ansible playbooks. The rollout is currently being planned, and will result in a much easier to maintain and restore the PHP project's infrastructure. In the future, all infrastructure will likely be managed through this.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-staff">The PHP Foundation Staff</h2>

<h3 id="renewing-contracts">Renewing contracts</h3>

<p>In 2023, we had a team of 6 developers. All of them demonstrated a high quality of work, and dedication to the mission of the foundation. We were happy to renew the contracts for 2024 as well as extend the total number of hours for developers requesting it.</p>

<p>We aim to review the rates every year based on the available funding and priorities.</p>

<h3 id="growing-the-team">Growing the Team</h3>

<p>As was mentioned in the previous transparency report, we aimed to extend the team. It did not happen in 2023 because one of the prospective developers could not join the team for personal reasons, and had to step down from PHP core development entirely. Again, this is <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/#the_bus_factor">the Bus Factor at its worst</a>. However, we were able to extend the team starting with 2024&#46;</p>

<p>Initially, we offered the new developers 6-month trial contracts so that the developers and the Governing Board can evaluate the results and then decide whether to continue the engagements. The results were far beyond our expectations. All new developers David Carlier, James Titcumb, Saki Takamachi, and Shivam Mathur demonstrated dedication and brought high value results, and demonstrated value.</p>

<h3 id="why-didn%E2%80%99t-we-add-more-developers%3F">Why didn’t we add more developers?</h3>

<p>In October 2024, following our usual process, we <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/09/17/application-form-2025/">opened applications</a> to expand or update our development team. We received many applications, including some from highly qualified candidates. However, we ultimately decided not to expand the team this time.</p>

<p><strong>The main reason is simple: budget constraints.</strong></p>

<p>Our funding from sponsorships determines how much we can afford, and we prioritize long-term stability over short-term expansion. Retaining the current team ensures we maintain the compound benefits of accumulated knowledge and experience. Growing the team temporarily, only to downsize later, would be counterproductive.</p>

<p>If we secure additional funding throughout the year, we may revisit the decision to expand the team.</p>

<h3 id="the-team-as-of-2025">The team as of 2025</h3>

<p>Starting from January, we continue contracting 10 developers to work on PHP:</p>

<ul>

<h2 id="retrospective%3A-goals-of-2024">Retrospective: Goals of 2024</h2>

<p>In the previous report, we outlined a few organizational and technical goals. Let’s look back and evaluate the results.</p>

<h3 id="organization-goals">Organization goals</h3>

<p><strong>Onboard new major sponsors ❌✅</strong><br />
We did have a few new and returning major sponsors, including Laravel, GoDaddy, Manychat. And of course we are happy about ongoing sponsorship from our founding members, and <a href="https://x.com/ThePHPF/status/1853390265429508427">increased commitment from Automattic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Explore strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities ✅</strong><br />
We did collaborate with the Sentry team on Open Source Pledge initiative</p>

<p><strong>Further develop the Advisory Board initiative ❌</strong><br />
The Advisory Board played a big role in <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/01/how-hooks-happened/">shaping the Hooks RFC</a>. However, we have much more potential. In 2025, we’d like to revamp the AB to make it more useful and collaborative.</p>

<p><strong>Grow the foundation's community ✅</strong><br />
The PHP Foundation Slack is an invite-only community, and its closed nature has helped keep it very productive. We gradually add more community leaders and developers, along with one-channel guests for specific tasks. We also maintain a public channel, <strong>&#35;php-internals</strong>, which is mirrored on the <a href="https://phpc.chat/">PHP Community Discord server</a>.</p>

<h3 id="technical-goals">Technical goals</h3>

<p><strong>Ongoing maintenance and development of the PHP core ✅</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deliver the STF projects ✅</strong></p>

<p><strong>Improve the quality of the ideas and RFCs coming from the foundation ✅</strong><br />
All of the RFCs from The PHP Foundation — even major ones like Hooks — passed the vote. We see that as a clear sign of the proposals’ quality.</p>

<p><strong>Conduct research and surveys to define priorities ❌✅</strong><br />
We conducted <a href="https://youtu.be/XE4g1Tl6RQw?si=6zlWRFlyaKnv9cji&amp;t=843">quantitative research</a> in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> team and<br />
JetBrains. However, we were unable to conduct a PHP community survey. Nevertheless, we supported <a href="https://www.zend.com/blog/2025-php-survey-launch">Zend by Perforce PHP Landscape Survey</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Develop a high-level roadmap for PHP changes sponsored by the foundation ❌</strong>
The roadmap and vision need further development and discussion. We plan to announce a few strategic moves in the upcoming months.</p>

<h2 id="php-language-impact">PHP Language Impact</h2>

<p>Every day, the PHP Foundation staff team contributes to the open-source repositories of the <a href="https://github.com/php">PHP GitHub organization</a>. The foundation team contributes in many forms: filing issues, reviewing pull requests, participating in discussions on mailing lists, triaging issues, submitting RFC proposals.</p>

<p>In this document, four categories of contributions are presented in more detail: commits to php-src, reviews of pull requests on php-src, submitted RFC documents, and documentation work.</p>

<h3 id="commits-to-php">Commits to PHP</h3>

<p>The following chart summarizes the number of commits made to the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a> repository in 2024&#46;</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2025/report-2024/commits.svg" alt="Commits" /></p>

<p>We’re happy to see not only an <strong>increase in commits from PHP Foundation</strong> developers but also a significant <strong>boost in contributions from other developers</strong> and the wider community. We consider this one of our biggest achievements and a strong sign of a thriving, <strong>healthy ecosystem</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the number of commits does not fairly represent the level of effort or the scope of the work. However, it can demonstrate the foundation's relative level of contribution to the PHP core through an objective metric.</p>

<h3 id="generics">Generics</h3>

<p>Generics are one of the most requested PHP features, but also the hardest. In 2024, the Foundation funded exploratory research into how generics might be implemented.  The <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/08/19/state-of-generics-and-collections/">result of that research</a> is available in its own blog post. In short, there is potential to make it happen but still some significant performance-related issues to resolve.</p>

<h3 id="release-maintenance">Release Maintenance</h3>

<p>Saki Takamachi, one of the Foundation developers, volunteered to be a release manager for PHP 8.4. The PHP Foundation supported such an initiative.</p>

<p>Jakub Zelenka, another foundation developer, continued duty as a release manager for PHP 8.3. Also supported by the foundation.</p>

<h3 id="security">Security</h3>

<p>The PHP Foundation contributed significantly to the 4 security releases. As per <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-8.1.31/NEWS">PHP 8.1 changelog</a>, most security issues were addressed by Niels Dossche (11), followed by the foundation developers Jakub Zelenka (6) and Arnaud Le Blanc (1). There has been additional work done in terms of reviews and release preparations.</p>

<p>In addition, various documentation security issues were fixed by the foundation developers as result of the security audit.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-and-the-eu-cyber-resilience-act">The PHP Foundation and the EU Cyber Resilience Act</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation is now a founding member of the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/04/02/open-source-community-cra-compliance-initiative/">Cyber Resilience Act Working Group</a>, giving us a key role in monitoring developments, representing PHP’s interests, and ensuring compliance with the regulation.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2025/report-2024/eu_cra_wg.png" alt="EU Cyber Resilience Act Working Group" /></p>

<p>Late last year, the group evolved into the <a href="https://orcwg.org/">Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group</a> (ORCWG). Jakub Zelenka, the Foundation developer, is part of the FAQ task force. That allows us to play an advisory role and help prepare the PHP ecosystem for the regulations.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2025/report-2024/open-source-pledge-logo-sticker.svg" width="400" alt="Open Source Pledge"/></p>

<p>In 2024, Sentry launched the <a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/">Open Source Pledge</a>, with the aim of encouraging companies that rely on Open Source systems to help directly fund Open Source development.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation is also <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/08/open-source-pledge/">a supporter of this effort</a>; contributing to Open Source is its entire purpose.  The Foundation also <a href="https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/">welcomes sponsorships</a> from companies and organizations that wish to support Open Source as part of their Pledge.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-brand-%26-public-channels">The PHP Foundation brand &amp; public channels</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation represents a community of core PHP developers and advocates for the PHP programming language. The PHP Foundation used the channels listed below for public communication:</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2025">Goals for 2025</h2>

<p>Our foremost mission remains the same: <strong>maintain and develop the PHP language</strong>. We’d like PHP to be the best platform for users and for businesses creating web applications and APIs.</p>

<p>The main challenge for continuing the work of The PHP Foundation is to ensure sustainable sponsorship.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, the goal is to ensure that foundation developers work on valuable tasks.</p>

<h3 id="organization-goals">Organization Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Secure funding to support core development and marketing initiatives.</li>
<li>Launch the "PHP 30" anniversary campaign in collaboration with JetBrains.</li>
<li>Consolidate and grow social media presence across multiple platforms.</li>
<li>Increase website traffic through improved documentation and resources.</li>
<li>Develop an Ambassador Program.</li>
<li>Begin preparation for the "PHP Next" marketing campaign to highlight PHP's modernization.</li>
<li>Modernize PHP's website with updated downloads page, documentation, and homepage.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-goals">Technical Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continue on-going maintenance and development of the PHP core.</li>
<li>Establish a working group for integrating modern HTTP server capabilities into PHP core.</li>
<li>Address key developer experience pain points, particularly for first-time users.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="budget-plan-for-2025">Budget plan for 2025</h2>

<p>In 2025, we adjusted the developers’ hours according to their availability, requests, and our budget restrictions.</p>

<p>With this plan, we estimate our annual spending cap at approximately <strong>$900,000</strong> for developer compensation.</p>

<p>Our collaboration with the OpenCollective platform has been positive, and we plan to continue operating under the umbrella of the Open Source Collective in 2025&#46; This means that sponsorships we receive are reduced by 10% for Open Source Collective fees and 0-5% for payment processing fees.</p>

<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>

<p>The PHP language is a living entity and, as such, requires continuous support to address developer issues, resolve security vulnerabilities, and has to evolve to meet the needs of the future.</p>

<p>Based on the strong third year of the foundation, we are excited to continue and multiply the efforts in the next years.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/"><strong>your help</strong></a>, we continue the mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP language.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow. Can you believe it? Just three years (and one day) ago, PHP had no organization behind it. Only two people were being paid to work on the language that powers 70% of the web.</p>

<p>Here’s the very first announcement about the creation of the PHP Foundation: 
<a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/">The New Life of PHP – The PHP Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fast-forward-to-today">Fast forward to today</h2>

<p>We now have a team of 10 talented engineers dedicated to PHP. We’re supported by major companies, governments, and an incredible community. That same community is creating amazing projects with PHP, while businesses continue to thrive thanks to a mature, secure, and performant language.</p>

<p>Since 2021, we’ve seen three PHP releases—PHP 8.2, 8.3, and the freshly released <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.4/en.php">PHP 8.4</a>. Here are just a few highlights from these releases, developed by the PHP Foundation team:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property hooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/asymmetric-visibility-v2">Asymmetric Visibility</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/lazy-objects">Lazy Objects</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/">New tool for installing extensions: pie</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/support_object_type_in_bcmath">Support object type in BCMath</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/saner-inc-dec-operators">Saner Increment/Decrement operators</a></li>
<li>Multiple type system improvements: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null-false-standalone-types">null and false as stand-alone types</a>, <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dnf_types">Disjunctive Normal Form Types</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/readonly_amendments">Readonly amendments</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dynamic_class_constant_fetch">Dynamic class constant fetch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/arbitrary_static_variable_initializers">Arbitrary static variable initializers</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feature-development-is-only-about-20%25-of-what-the-foundation-team-does">Feature development is only about 20% of what the foundation team does</h2>

<p>Behind the scenes, there’s a lot more: triaging and fixing issues, handling security reports, reviewing code, updating documentation, and maintaining infrastructure. All of this work empowers the community and ensures PHP is stable and reliable.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The total contributions to the PHP repositories grew by 51+%</li>
<li>We conducted the first external security audit for PHP in 10 years</li>
<li>We extended security support for PHP versions by one year</li>
<li>We improved CI and testing infrastructure</li>
<li>We introduced automated benchmarks to track performance regressions</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this would be possible without our sponsors. Huge thanks to every company and individual who has supported us over the past three years!</p>

<p>Special shout-outs to:<br />
JetBrains, Automattic, Sovereign Tech Agency, Craft CMS, Private Packagist, Tideways, Zend by Perforce, Laravel, Symfony, Mercari Inc., Les-Tilleuls.coop, pixiv Inc., Aternos GmbH, Sentry, Ardennes-étape, Cybozu,</p>

<p>and many others — PHP is all of us!</p>

<p>Here’s to PHP and many more years ahead!<br />
