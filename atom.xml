            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PHP 8.5 is still warm, but the work to push PHP forward continues.  The latest major feature for PHP 8.6 has just been approved: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/partial_function_application_v2">Partial Function Application</a> (PFA).</p>

<h2 id="the-gist">The gist</h2>

<p>In PHP 8.6, it will be possible to create a closure that simply delegates to another function without writing out the whole closure.</p>

<pre><code class="php">// This
$underscore = str_replace(' ', '_', ?);

// Is effectively the same as this:
$underscore = fn(string $s): string =&gt; str_replace(' ' , '_', $s);
</code></pre>

<p>Both lines will produce nearly identical opcodes, but the former is much easier to both write and to read, as it doesn't require messing about with redeclaring all the types and variable names.</p>

<p>Any function (or method) call may use one of two placeholders, <code>?</code> or <code>...</code>, to indicate that it is only "partially invoking" that function.  Or "partially applying arguments to it."  It works with both positional and named arguments, too!</p>

<pre><code class="php">function complex(int $a, int $b, int $c, int $d): string { ... }

// This creates a closure that takes 2 ints and returns a string.
$f = complex(?, 2, ?, 4);

// This creates the same closure, but with named arguments.
$f = complex(b: 2, d: 4, ...);

// This reverses the order of the parameters, $f needs $c first, then $a.
$f = complex(b: 2, d: 4, c: ?, a: ?);

// Keep all arguments unbound. Hey look, first-class-callables!
$f = complex(...);

// This creates a zero argument closure, which just calls complex() when invoked!
$f = complex(1, 2, 3, 4, ...);
</code></pre>

<p>PFA supports a wide variety of complex use cases and features, like parameter reordering, named arguments, variadics, etc.  In practice, however, we expect most uses to be reducing a function down to a single remaining argument (that is, currying).  That makes it perfect to use as a callback.  Most of PHP's functions that take callbacks expect a single argument, and the few remaining take two (such as a value and a key).  PFA makes using arbitrarily complex, contextually aware functions in those cases trivially easy.</p>

<pre><code class="php">// This
$result = array_map(in_array(?, $legal, strict: true), $input);

// is much nicer than this
$result = array_map(fn(string $s): bool =&gt; in_array($s, $legal, strict: true), $input);
</code></pre>

<p>By design, it's also the perfect complement for the new <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.functional.php">pipe operator</a>.  To reuse some examples from the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v3">Pipe RFC</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$numberOfAdmins = getUsers()
    |&gt; array_filter(?, isAdmin(...))
    |&gt; count(...);

$result = "Hello World"
    |&gt; htmlentities(...)
    |&gt; str_split(...)
    |&gt; array_map(strtoupper(...), ?)
    |&gt; array_filter(?, fn($v) =&gt; $v != 'O')
;
</code></pre>

<p>What's more, optimizations around the pipe operator mean the closure doesn't even need to be created in those cases, so there's zero performance overhead.</p>

<p>The RFC has more details on all the ins and outs of the new syntax.</p>

<h2 id="the-long-view">The long view</h2>

<p>If all of this sounds a lot like an extended version of "first class callables," it should.  Or rather, "first class callables," are the training wheels version of partial function application.</p>

<p>PFA was <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/partial_function_application">first proposed</a> way back in 2021, by a team of Joe Watkins, Levi Morrison, Paul Crovella, and myself.  That version was largely similar on the surface, but had a different implementation that caused some consternation.  In particular, Nikita Popov (at the time still PHP's de facto lead developer) felt that it introduced too much complexity in the engine.  His hesitancy convinced many others to reject it at the time, though there was still a lot of interest and support.</p>

<p>There was enough support, however, that Nikita asked "couldn't we just do <code>foo(...)</code> to delay all the variables, and skip the rest of the RFC?"  The result of that was the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/first_class_callable_syntax">First Class Callables</a> RFC, released in PHP 8.1.</p>

<p>I've been looking to take a second swing at PFA since then, but needed the right time and right collaborators.  FCC has clearly shown itself to be a huge boon to the language, so why not go all the way?  It wasn't until the Pipes RFC passed earlier this year, though, that I was able to snare the PHP Foundation's Arnaud Le Blanc into working on a second version with me.  It didn't quite make it into PHP 8.5 for timing reasons, but it's now available in 8.6.</p>

<p>So what changed?  One, FCC ended up already including a lot of the underlying engine trickery that was needed for this version of PFA.  We were able to leverage that.  For another, the implementation is a bit different.  Rather than creating a special kind of pseudo-closure that can be extra-optimized, the new approach just creates a normal closure object like we've had for years.  That makes it much simpler to implement and solve a ton of edge-case questions.  Three, now we have pipes.</p>

<p>And oh boy is this an exciting combination.</p>

<h2 id="a-long-time-coming">A long time coming</h2>

<p>PFA for PHP really began even before 2021.  As discussed in the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/07/11/php-85-adds-pipe-operator/">Pipes blog post</a> from July, way back in 2016 Sara Golemon proposed porting Hack/HHVM's pipe syntax to PHP:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$result = $arr
    |&gt; array_column($$, 'tags')
    |&gt; array_merge(...$$)
    |&gt; array_unique($$)
    |&gt; array_values($$)
;
</code></pre>

<p>That was never approved, but led us to try splitting the syntax in two: The pipe operator itself, and partial function application instead of <code>$$</code>.  We tried in 2021 to get both, but both failed.  Now we have both.</p>

<p>One of the chief criticisms I've seen about the new pipe operator is the need to wrap up multi-parameter functions into an inline arrow function, and then wrap that in <code>()</code> to keep the parser happy.  Which is a fair criticism!  And the perfect fix for that criticism is... partial function application.  Which we now have.  The twins have been reunited.</p>

<h2 id="php-breaks-the-mold">PHP breaks the mold</h2>

<p>I've often seen PHP criticized for just stealing features from other languages and piling them in willy-nilly.  Frankly that's not always a bad thing: PHP, much like English, evolves by finding good ideas in other languages and <em>ahem</em> borrowing them, and making it our own.</p>

<p>Partial function application is not a new concept.  It's been the foundation of many functional languages for decades.  Haskell, for instance, implicitly uses partial application for literally every function call.  Any function call can just omit its right-most arguments and poof, it becomes a partial application.</p>

<p>What I have not seen in any language, however, is the ability to partially apply arbitrary parameters.  That's important for PHP, because while Haskell's entire standard library was built around the assumption of right-most partial application, PHP's most definitely was not.  We needed to be able to turn arbitrary functions into unary (single-argument) functions to allow most parts of the standard library to work with... pipes.  Or as callbacks.</p>

<p>And now we can.  I do not know of any other language that has as flexible, powerful, and compact a partial function application syntax as PHP 8.6 will have.  Here, PHP would seem to be the innovator.</p>

<p>Rock on, ElePHPants!</p>

<h2 id="what-comes-next%3F">What comes next?</h2>

<p>There's one more major piece of the puzzle still to come: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/function-composition">Function composition</a>.  Where pipe executes immediately, function composition creates a new function by sticking two functions end-to-end.  Sara Golemon helpfully got it started, but it still needs some work before it can be formally proposed.</p>

<p>That would complete the trifecta of "Functional Features" we've been trying to get into PHP for years to allow a much more natural use of functional techniques.</p>

<p>Each of these RFCs is, on its own, useful but not earth-shattering.  Taken together... "synergy" may be a dirty word outside of management consulting, but in this case it applies.  We are very close to blowing open PHP's functional capabilities in much the way that PHP 5.2 finally blew open its object-oriented capabilities.  And as a multi-paradigm language, we'll be able to freely mix and match OOP and FP approaches where they make the most sense.</p>

<p>I can't wait!</p>

<p>It didn’t quite meet the “accessible and lightweight” brief, but it earned an honorary mention for spirit and commitment to vintage web aesthetics.</p>

<h2 id="%2A%2Anext-steps%2A%2A"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>

<p>We will collaborate with Nuno Guerra to polish the winning design and may incorporate ideas from other entries where they improve clarity or accessibility. And finally we’ll adapt it to <a href="https://php.net">php.net</a>’s stack.</p>

<p>In the spirit of PHP, contributions are welcome! We encourage all participants to join the <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php/issues/1592"><strong>implementation thread</strong></a> and help refine the final page.</p>

<h2 id="%2A%2Ahow-the-scoring-worked%2A%2A"><strong>How the scoring worked</strong></h2>

<p>We combined a jury score with a community vote and <strong>used a logarithmic transform</strong> to reduce social-media spikes. We counted <strong>👍 during the voting window</strong> for each shortlisted entry and <strong>ignored 👎</strong> and other reactions.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Jury (40%)</strong><br />
Judges scored four criteria from 0 to 5. For each entry we averaged judges into <code>J</code> in the range 0–25.<br />
Normalization: <code>J_norm = J / 25</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Community vote (60%), log-damped</strong><br />
For entry <em>i</em> with <code>V_i</code> upvotes and <code>T = Σ V_i</code> across the shortlist:<br />
<code>V′_i = log(1 + V_i)</code> and <code>V_logshare = V′_i / Σ V′_k</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Final score</strong><br />
Final <code>= 0.4 × J_norm + 0.6 × V_logshare</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>We will publish the full table with anonymized jury subtotals and final scores.</p>

<p>We might not run this contest format again. <strong>But if we did, here’s what we would fix:</strong></p>

<h3 id="%2A%2A1-scope-%26-brief%3A-on-brand-update-vs-full-rework%2A%2A"><strong>1) Scope &amp; brief: on-brand update vs full rework</strong></h3>

<p>The scope was the <strong>PHP 8.5 release page</strong> with an <strong>on-brand</strong> constraint. Some entries explored broader rebrands.</p>

<p><strong>Next time we would</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Be more explicit on on-brand requirement.</li>
<li><p>Potentially Split into <strong>two tracks</strong> judged and presented <strong>separately</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Track A:</strong> on-brand update of the specific page.<br />
<strong>Track B:</strong> blue-sky concept for future reference.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="%2A%2A2-%E2%80%9Cspec-work%E2%80%9D-concerns%2A%2A"><strong>2) “Spec work” concerns</strong></h3>

<p>We kept scope small, didn’t require code, and recognized more than one entry (runner-up and shortlist thanks).</p>

<p><strong>Next time we would:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Prepare a more detailed brief with the community.</li>
<li>Offer a <strong>paid shortlist honorarium</strong>.</li>
<li>Cap deliverables (mock-ups plus optional tiny HTML/CSS), no heavy code.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="%2A%2A3-voting-%26-balance-order-bias%2C-social-reach%2C-weights%2A%2A"><strong>3) Voting &amp; balance (order bias, social reach, weights)</strong></h3>

<p>Order bias and social amplification are real. In this contest we <strong>ignored downvotes</strong> and <strong>used log damping</strong> on upvotes.</p>

<p><strong>Next time we would also:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use a dedicated voting tool that shuffles candidates.</li>
<li>Optionally hide aggregate reaction counts until voting closes.</li>
<li>Set a 50/50 split between jury and community.</li>
<li>Publish the full calculation sheet upfront for auditability.</li>
</ul>

            <link href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/10/30/php-streams-evolution/"/>
            <updated>2025-10-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/10/30/php-streams-evolution/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to investment from the <strong><a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/">Sovereign Tech Agency (STA)</a></strong>, a German government backed organization supporting open-source infrastructure, the PHP Foundation is modernizing one of PHP’s oldest and most critical subsystems: Streams.</p>

<p>This post outlines the planned work and explains why these changes matter for the PHP ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-php-streams%3F">What Are PHP Streams?</h2>

<p>Before diving into the improvements, let’s briefly revisit what Streams are and why they matter.</p>

<p>Introduced around 2001, PHP streams provide a unified way to handle file and network I/O, allowing data from different sources such as files, sockets, or memory to be accessed through a consistent API using the same set of functions.</p>

<p>Over time, PHP streams have proven to be a powerful and flexible subsystem, but some parts of the implementation have not evolved alongside modern use cases, performance expectations, and system capabilities. This project aims to make Streams faster, safer, and easier to extend for modern PHP applications.</p>

<p>The actual scope is divided into four subsections.</p>

<h2 id="performance-and-stability-improvements">Performance and Stability improvements</h2>

<p>This part aims to improve performance and consistency in how PHP Streams copying and seeking.</p>

<p>There is still room to improve performance in stream copying.</p>

<p>For example, copying large files or handling network transfers can be made faster through asynchronous I/O mechanisms like io_uring on Linux. At the same time, we need to prevent potential crashes caused by memory-mapped files. The goal is to phase out mmap usage and introduce a new copying API as part of the upcoming I/O API, using io_uring or other system features where available.</p>

<p>Seeking is currently problematic for filtered streams, which causes various inconsistencies. Developers working with filters often encounter limitations when rewinding or skipping data.</p>

<p>The plan is to introduce a new seeking filter API that will allow seeking in streams where possible and disallow it where not. For example, seeking to the beginning should always be possible, but not all filters support seeking to arbitrary positions. Some may allow it, so a new internal API is needed.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling-and-monitoring-enhancements">Error Handling and Monitoring Enhancements</h2>

<p>This part is mainly about the introduction of new error reporting mechanisms for streams as well as the introduction of more hooks. Currently, many low-level I/O errors are surfaced inconsistently to user space. The goal is to standardize how Streams report errors and make them easier to debug.</p>

<p>The primary idea for error reporting is to have a better way to handle errors so they can be collected and reported to user space. We’ll wrap existing errors and provide richer context options for developers.</p>

<p>In terms of hooks, this would be useful for async code and could be done through a special polling wrapper. There should be some way to allow replacing some blocking operations (specifically for file IO). This is primarily meant as an internal change, but it will also be considered to possibly expose some hooks to user space if convenient and acceptable from a performance point of view.</p>

<h2 id="networking-and-socket-improvements">Networking and Socket Improvements</h2>

<p>This part is mainly about the introduction of a new polling API, improvements in the stream_select function, and resolving issues in socket handling.</p>

<p>Modern network applications rely heavily on scalable event handling. The new polling API will introduce modern mechanisms such as epoll and kqueue, enabling PHP to handle multiple I/O streams more efficiently.</p>

<p>Currently, only select is available for user space, which has known performance and scaling issues. This modernization will benefit frameworks and extensions that implement async networking or event-driven I/O.</p>

<p>The purpose of the API is primarily to build an internal API that can be used internally for various tasks in the PHP core and as a base (fallback) for the future async IO API.</p>

<p>The stream_select usage should be extended to better handle polling of filtered streams and provide an API for external objects that can provide extra data, as will be possible in the new polling API. This will require some refactoring and potentially sharing some of the logic with the new polling API.</p>

<p>Additionally, several socket-specific improvements are planned. New socket context options will be added to provide better configuration capabilities. Various socket handling issues will be addressed, and utilities for working with file descriptors will be improved.</p>

<h2 id="security-and-tls-enhancements">Security and TLS Enhancements</h2>

<p>Another important part of this work targets the OpenSSL extension, which handles encrypted streams.</p>

<p>Specifically, refactoring its async handling that is currently not well implemented and has various limitations. The refactoring will clarify what polling action is required for user space. For example, whether the stream needs to wait for reading or writing.</p>

<p>In addition, we aim to improve TLS 1.3 support with options to select cipher suites and integrate TLS Sessions, PSK (Pre-Shared Key) and early data (0-RTT) support.</p>

<p>To enable these changes, a new TLS 1.3 PHP testing library is being developed. It will allow customizing the protocol flow and testing TLS 1.3 features, including asynchronous behavior.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>Together, these efforts will modernize and strengthen PHP’s I/O layer for the next decade of web and CLI development.</p>

<p>Work has started in 2025 and will go through 2026. Incremental progress will be shared publicly through PHP Foundation updates and PHP internals discussions, and RFCs.</p>

<p>We’re grateful to the Sovereign Tech Agency for supporting this foundational investment in PHP’s core. Stay tuned for technical write-ups and benchmarks as the implementation progresses.</p>

            <link href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/10/10/php-85-uri-extension/"/>
            <updated>2025-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/10/10/php-85-uri-extension/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>URLs are a fundamental building block of the Web we rely on every day.</p>

<p>Their familiarity makes them appear deceptively simple: Seemingly clearly
delineated components like scheme, hostname, path, and some others suggest that
it’s trivial to extract information from a URL. In reality, there are thousands
of custom parsers built over the years, each with their own take on details.</p>

<p>For us web developers, there are two main standards specifying how URLs are
supposed to work. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>,
which is the original URI standard from 2005; and the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/">WHATWG URL Living
Standard</a>, which is followed by web browsers.
Because things are not as simple as they appear at first glance, these two
commonly used standards are incompatible with each other&#33; Mixing and matching
different standards and their parsers, especially when they do not <em>exactly</em>
follow the standard, is something that <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/10/dont-mix-url-parsers/">commonly leads to security
issues</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-change-was-needed">Why Change Was Needed</h2>

<p>Despite the importance of correctly parsing URLs, PHP did not include any
standards-compliant parser within the standard library for the longest time.
There is the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-url.php"><code>parse_url()</code></a> function,
which has existed since PHP 4, but it does not follow any standard and is
explicitly documented not to be used with untrusted or malformed URLs.
Nevertheless, it is commonly used for lack of a better alternative that is
readily available and also because it appears to work correctly for a majority
of well-formed inputs that developers encounter in day-to-day work. This can
mislead developers to believe that the security issues of <code>parse_url()</code> are a
purely theoretical problem rather than something that <em>will</em> cause issues
sooner or later.</p>

<p>As an example, the input URL <code>example.com/example/:8080/foo</code> is a valid URL
consisting of only a relative path according to RFC 3986&#46; It is invalid
according to the WHATWG URL standard when not resolved against a base URL.
However, according to <code>parse_url()</code> it is a URL for the host <code>example.com</code>,
port 8080 and path <code>/example/:8080/foo</code>, thus including the 8080 in <em>two</em> of
the resulting components:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

var_dump(parse_url('example.com/example/:8080/foo'));

/*
array(3) {
  ["host"]=&gt; string(11) "example.com"
  ["port"]=&gt; int(8080)
  ["path"]=&gt; string(18) "/example/:8080/foo"
}
*/
</code></pre>

<h2 id="introducing-a-new-api">Introducing a New API</h2>

<p>This changes with PHP 8.5. Going forward, PHP will include standards-compliant
parsers for both RFC 3986 and the WHATWG URL standard as an <em>always-available</em>
part of its standard library within a new “URI” extension. Not only will this
enable easy, correct, and secure parsing of URLs according to the respective
standard, but the URI extension also includes functionality to modify
individual components of a URL.</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

use Uri\Rfc3986\Uri;

$url = new Uri('HTTPS://thephp.foundation:443/sp%6Fnsor/');

$defaultPortForScheme = match ($url-&gt;getScheme()) {
    'http' =&gt; 80,
    'https' =&gt; 443,
    'ssh' =&gt; 22,
    default =&gt; null,
};

// Remove default ports from URLs.
if ($url-&gt;getPort() === $defaultPortForScheme) {
    $url = $url-&gt;withPort(null);
}

// Getters normalize the URL by default. The `Raw`
// variants return the input unchanged.

echo $url-&gt;toString(), PHP_EOL;
// Prints: https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/
echo $url-&gt;toRawString(), PHP_EOL;
// Prints: HTTPS://thephp.foundation/sp%6Fnsor/
</code></pre>

<h2 id="thoughtfully-built-to-last">Thoughtfully Built to Last</h2>

<p>In this post we not only want to showcase the functionality but also tell you
the story of how this project developed and how work gets done in PHP to keep
the language modern and a great choice for web development. There is often more
work behind new PHP features than meets the eye. We hope to provide some
insight into why we prefer doing things right rather than fast.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kocsismate">Máté Kocsis</a> from The PHP Foundation’s dev team
initially started discussion for his <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api">RFC of a new URL parsing
API</a> in June 2024&#46; Given PHP’s
strong backwards compatibility promise, the new API needed to get things right
on the first attempt in order to serve the PHP community well for the decade to
come without introducing disruptive changes. Thus, over the course of <em>almost
one year</em>, <a href="https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/123997">more than 150 emails on the PHP Internals
list</a> were sent. Additionally,
several off-list discussions in various chat rooms have been had. Throughout
this process, various experts from the PHP community continuously refined the
RFC. They discussed even seemingly insignificant details, to provide not just a
standards-compliant implementation, but also a clean and robust API that will
guide developers towards the right solution for their use case. We also planned
ahead and made sure that the new URI extension with its dedicated <code>Uri</code>
namespace provides a clear path forward to add additional URI/URL-related
functionality in future versions of PHP.</p>

<p>The RFC ultimately went to vote in May 2025 and was accepted with a 30:1 vote.
But work didn’t stop there: The proposed API also had to be implemented and
reviewed. Instead of building a PHP-specific solution, Máté opted to stand on
the shoulders of giants and selected two libraries to perform the heavy
lifting. The <a href="https://uriparser.github.io/">uriparser library</a> provides the RFC
3986 parser, and the <a href="https://lexbor.com/">Lexbor library</a>, which is already
used by PHP 8.4’s new DOM API, provides the WHATWG parser.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-collaboration">Open Source Collaboration</h2>

<p>As part of the integration, Máté and The PHP Foundation worked together with
the upstream maintainers to include missing functionality in the respective
libraries. As an example, neither library included functionality to cheaply
duplicate the internal data structures, which was necessary to support cloning
the readonly PHP objects representing the parsed URL when attempting to modify
individual components with the so-called with-er methods (e.g.,
<code>-&gt;withPort(8080)</code>). The uriparser library also did not include any functions
for modifying components of a parsed URL. All this functionality is now
available in the upstream libraries for everyone to use and benefit from.</p>

<p>The review and testing of Máté’s PHP implementation was carried out by PHP
community contributors <a href="https://github.com/nielsdos/">Niels Dossche</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/nyamsprod/">Ignace Nyamagana Butera</a>. This included
reviewing and testing the new functionality that had been added to the two
upstream libraries. <a href="https://thephp.foundation/#sponsors_silver">Tideways, a founding member and Silver
sponsor</a> of The PHP Foundation,
also sponsored engineering time; their contribution came in the form of <a href="https://github.com/TimWolla/">Tim
Düsterhus</a>. During the review and testing, these
reviewers discovered several pre-existing bugs in the upstream libraries. They
submitted fixes to the upstream maintainers, <a href="https://github.com/hartwork">Sebastian
Pipping</a> (uriparser) and <a href="https://github.com/lexborisov">Alexander
Borisov</a> (Lexbor), who quickly reviewed and
applied them.</p>

<h2 id="test-it-now">Test It Now</h2>

<p>This work paid off, and PHP’s new URI extension with not just one but two
feature-rich and standards-compliant URI implementations is fully available for
testing with PHP 8.5 RC 1&#46;</p>

You can also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qTJgx2QF9M">Roman Pronskiy's video overview</a> of what the Foundation is working on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're opening a regular round of applications for developer positions. We intend to decide on whom we will hire by the end of November. If selected, you would start your work January 1st, 2026.</p>

<p>The application form will be <strong>open until October 30, 2025</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="https://forms.gle/v9iTTRFwemRkZett7" class="inline-block py-2 no-underline px-6 !text-white bg-[#7f52ff] rounded-3xl hover:bg-[rgba(127,82,255,.8)]">Apply</a>
</p>

<div class="alert italic">
    <span class="inline-block font-bold">⚠️ Note: This is not a job for PHP developers or aspiring PHP developers.</span><br><br>
The development of <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">the PHP core</a> is done in the С programming language, and requires proficiency in system programming.
</div>

<h2 id="what-are-the-requirements%3F">What are the requirements?</h2>

<p>As before, we require experience in PHP core development. Ideally, you should have all, but at least some of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pull-requests / commits to <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a></li>
<li>Experience in writing PHP extensions</li>
<li>Participation in PHP mailing lists</li>
<li>Contributions to other open-source projects</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-are-you-going-to-work-on%3F">What are you going to work on?</h2>

<p>Strategic areas we'd like you to work on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Web APIs (json, PDO, streams, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list. We encourage you to <strong>provide as detailed a description of what you want to work on as possible</strong>.</p>

<p>Our primary selection criterion is <strong>pragmatism</strong>. We place greater emphasis on solutions that improve the developer experience and benefit businesses that rely on PHP, rather than new syntax features.</p>

<p>Out of scope:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pure documentation works</li>
<li>Userland PHP packages</li>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Translations</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-working-with-the-php-foundation-involve%3F">What does working with the PHP Foundation involve?</h2>

<p>Working for the PHP Foundation offers a lot of freedom, but it also requires discipline. Your work will roughly consist of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>40% Triaging issues and fixing bugs</li>
<li>30% Working on strategic areas</li>
<li>20% Code reviews</li>
<li>&#62;10% Preparing RFCs and developing new language features</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, developing new RFCs is a fairly small part of the job. Most of the work is typical maintenance of an open-source project.</p>

<p>We are a fully distributed team. You can work from any place<strong>&#42;</strong> and at any time. All communication is asynchronous via Slack, GitHub, and Email. We meet for synchronous calls once a month.</p>

<p>Your work should be in line with the foundation's mission statement, and we expect you to follow <a href="https://thephp.foundation/code-of-conduct/">the code of conduct</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>PHP Foundation Mission Statement</strong></p>

            <link href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/09/25/joe-watkins/"/>
            <updated>2025-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/09/25/joe-watkins/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re excited to share that Joe Watkins is joining the PHP Foundation as a contractor for the rest of 2025&#46;</p>

<p>Joe has helped <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/">establish the PHP Foundation</a> in 2021 and is a long-time contributor to PHP core. He is known for his work on extensions like <a href="https://github.com/krakjoe/parallel">parallel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov">PCOV</a> and most recently, he released <a href="https://krakjoe.github.io/ort/">ORT</a>, a blazing-fast ONNX runtime for PHP bringing native AI inference capabilities to PHP developers for the first time.</p>

<p>This decision comes outside our usual funding cycle, and it’s driven by two key factors:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Joe’s renewed health and momentum.</strong> While we initially planned to bring Joe on board in August 2024, his health at the time didn’t allow it. After reviewing our budget post-H1 2025 and realizing we had extra room, we saw an opportunity to support Joe’s return and enable him to contribute once again.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The impact of his work.</strong> ORT is a concrete step toward making PHP more capable and future-proof. Beyond code, Joe has also contributed to the PHP process itself — having proposed and championed several process-related RFCs over the years that helped shape how PHP evolves.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Joe is contracted for a limited number of hours in H2 2025&#46; For 2026, he will be welcome to apply through our regular contributor funding process later this month, alongside others.</p>

<p>Here is what Joe has to say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we established The PHP Foundation, we were focused on raising the bus factor of PHP.</p>
  
  <p>It's years later now, and the bus factor is no longer a major concern. The Foundation has contracted and trained very skilled developers, and the effort they have put in cannot be understated.<br />
  <br />
  Moreover, we have the means to train and pay new developers, should the ones we have now decide to pursue other professional opportunities.</p>
  
  <p>We also imagined that from The Foundation would emerge a vision for PHP, something loosely resembling a roadmap. This isn't because The Foundation wanted to take control of the direction of the project, but rather a more practical concern. Namely, it's difficult to get sponsorship for "maintenance and development". It's easier to convince businesses to sponsor our activities when we know our goals are aligned.</p>
  
  <p>No such road map has materialized; The Foundation has many generous businesses sponsoring the work that goes on, but the bi-directional communication between sponsors and developers is limited, and so alignment is not assured.</p>
  
  <p>I joined the foundation as a developer so that I can address this problem.</p>
  
  <p>My intention is to be the conduit between sponsors (the board members) and developers, to advocate for developers, and to communicate with them on behalf of the board.</p>
  
  <p>I will also, as a developer, be able to advance my own ideas for the future of PHP.</p>
  
  <p>PHP has been around for so long it feels like a part of the furniture of the web. It seems obvious that in ten years, PHP will still be relevant, as it was for the last ten and the ten years before that.</p>
  
  <p>This isn't really the case; PHP has thrived because the ecosystem of the web allowed it to. While internals is focused on the development of the language at a syntax and API level, there's limited discussion of PHP "the product". PHP is a product, and The Foundation has to function something like a business, although our profit is measured in progress rather than pennies. We need to ask questions about adoption rates and relevance in a changing digital landscape. We must be able to answer these questions.</p>
  
  <p>With an increase in bi-directional communication between board and developers, and the clarity this brings to our shared and declared goals, we can start to answer these questions.</p>
  
  <p>If I succeed in my goals, there will emerge a roadmap, a physical document you can link to. But perhaps more importantly, we will have the necessary processes and structure in place within The Foundation to develop and maintain that roadmap and required alignment so that our work continues to address the concerns of the businesses paying for it.</p>

            <link href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/09/05/php-mcp-sdk/"/>
            <updated>2025-09-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/09/05/php-mcp-sdk/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>The PHP Foundation</strong>, <strong>Anthropic’s MCP team, and Symfony</strong> are collaborating on the <strong>official PHP SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong>. Our goal is a <strong>framework-agnostic, production-ready</strong> reference implementation the PHP ecosystem can rely on.</p>

<p>The Symfony team will lead maintenance, with contributions from the broader community, including <a href="https://github.com/CodeWithKyrian">Kyrian Obikwelu</a> (<a href="https://github.com/php-mcp">PHP-MCP</a>).</p>

<p>This initiative consolidates earlier work into a single, trusted implementation – <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk"><strong>modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk</strong></a> – starting with the server and expanding to client capabilities.</p>

<p>⭐ Star the repo, try it, open issues/PRs, and join discussions.</p>

<!--
- [Symfony announcement](https://symfony.com/blog/symfony-to-provide-the-official-mcp-sdk)  
- [MCP blog announcement]()
-->

<h2 id="%2A%2Awhat-is-mcp-and-why-is-it-important%2A%2A"><strong>What is MCP and why is it important</strong></h2>

<p>The <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) is an open protocol introduced by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a> to enable AI applications to connect with and utilize external tools and data sources, akin to a standardized "USB-C port" for AI systems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>💡 Fun fact: MCP co-creator <a href="https://x.com/dsp_"><strong>David Soria Parra</strong></a> was release manager for <a href="https://wiki.php.net/todo/php54">PHP 5.4</a> and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/todo/php55">5.5</a>, and a long-time PHP core contributor. His PHP code still runs inside <a href="https://github.com/symfony/http-foundation/blob/6.1/IpUtils.php#L105">every Symfony and Laravel project</a> today. Cheers, David! 💜</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To make it easier to build MCP servers, the community provides SDKs – lightweight frameworks that handle the protocol details so developers can focus on their applications.</p>

<p>There were several official SDKs for different programming languages. However, there was no official PHP SDK, even though a few community implementations existed.</p>

<p>That’s why <strong>the PHP Foundation stepped up to coordinate</strong> the development and maintenance of the official PHP SDK for MCP.</p>

<p>This brings two important benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <strong>trusted reference implementation</strong> developers can rely on.</li>
<li>Visibility of <strong>PHP’s readiness for AI development</strong> outside its own ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="%2A%2Awhat%E2%80%99s-happening%2A%2A"><strong>What’s happening</strong></h2>

<p><strong>The PHP Foundation</strong> has partnered with the MCP team at <strong>Anthropic</strong> and the <strong>Symfony</strong> team to develop the <strong>official MCP SDK for PHP.</strong></p>

<p>The Symfony team will be lead maintainers of the SDK as they have a proven track record of building high-quality framework-agnostic components that much of the PHP ecosystem relies on.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="https://github.com/CodeWithKyrian">Kyrian Obikwelu</a> joined the maintainer team and brings his previous experience and work on MCP libraries. Other PHP MCP SDK authors are welcome to participate as well.</p>

<p><strong>Roadmap (high level):</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Server-side building blocks (initial release)</li>
<li>Client capabilities and additional transports as the spec evolves</li>
<li>Docs, examples, and stability hardening driven by real-world use</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll keep this implementation framework-agnostic so it works well in any platform, legacy apps, and custom stacks. Community adapters and examples will live alongside the core packages.</p>

<h2 id="%2A%2Aget-involved%2A%2A"><strong>Get involved</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Try it:</strong> install the SDK, scaffold a small MCP server, and expose one or two safe tools.</p>

<p><strong>Contribute:</strong> issues, docs, and PRs are very welcome – especially around testing, and real-world examples.</p>

<p><strong>Bring your framework:</strong> we’re keen on first‑class integrations for Laravel, WordPress, Drupal, Laminas, and more. We keep a list of integrations in the repo as well.</p>

<p><strong>Start here:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>SDK repo: <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk"><strong>modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk</strong></a></li>
<li>Composer package: <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/mcp/sdk"><strong>https://packagist.org/packages/mcp/sdk</strong></a></li>
<li>MCP spec &amp; ecosystem: <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18"><strong>https://modelcontextprotocol.io/</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://symfony.com/blog/let-s-build-the-symfony-ai-ecosystem-together"><strong>Join the Symfony AI Hackathon</strong></a><br />
  The in-person event will be <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ML4e5SqtcwGRYJH8A">hosted at Quentic in Berlin</a>, and requires a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/symfony-ai-hackathon-tickets-1591414586869">free registration via Eventbrite</a> upfront. For online participation, please make sure to join our <a href="https://symfony.com/slack">Slack Workspace</a> and the &#35;ai channel to follow along and raise your topics or questions.</p>

<p>This SDK helps ensure PHP is visible as a great language choice to a wider audience when working in the AI ecosystem.
Let’s build it together!<br />
