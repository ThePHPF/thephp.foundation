            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>As of early 2025, The PHP Foundation comprises <strong>8 volunteer board members</strong>, <strong>an Executive Director</strong> sponsored by JetBrains, and <strong>10 developers</strong> paid part-time/full-time who contribute significantly to the PHP language and its extensions.</p>

<p>In 2024, The PHP Foundation received <strong>$683,550 in donations and investments</strong> from organizations and individuals.</p>

<p>The foundation‚Äôs primary focus in 2024 remained strengthening the maintenance of PHP core, housed in the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a> GitHub repository. This project is the home of the PHP language, where PHP‚Äôs interpreter is developed. Everyone who uses PHP benefits in one way or another from the work that is done in this repository.</p>

<p>The 10 part-time and full-time developers contracted by The PHP Foundation were responsible for a substantial portion of the commits and reviews made to the PHP language.</p>

<p><strong>Key achievements in 2024 included:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Completion of projects funded by the Sovereign Tech Fund</li>
<li>Expansion of the development team</li>
<li>Increased contributions to PHP core</li>
<li>Enhanced community engagement and sponsor relations</li>
</ul>

<p>The foundation <strong>plans to spend up to $900,000 in 2025</strong>, including compensation and fees. We continue to seek additional sponsor contributions to sustain and expand these efforts in the coming years.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-mission">The PHP Foundation Mission</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation‚Äôs mission remains focused on ensuring the long-term prosperity of the PHP language. Our priorities continue to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improving the language for users</li>
<li>Providing high-quality maintenance</li>
<li>Improving the project to retain current contributors and integrate new ones</li>
<li>Promoting the public image of PHP</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-sponsors">The PHP Foundation Sponsors</h2>

<h2 id="projects-for-the-sovereign-tech-agency-delivered-successfully">Projects for The Sovereign Tech Agency Delivered Successfully</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/">Sovereign Tech Agency</a> (STA) supports the development, improvement, and maintenance of open digital infrastructure in the public interest. Its goal is to strengthen the open-source ecosystem sustainably, focusing on security, resilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the code. STF is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) and supported by the German Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation GmbH (SPRIND).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2025/report-2024/sta.png" width="597" alt="STA"></p>

<p>The Sovereign Tech Agency commissioned work on four major projects, all of which we successfully delivered. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the results.</p>

<h3 id="pecl-overhaul">PECL Overhaul</h3>

<p>The previous system for distributing PHP extensions, PECL/PEAR, is outdated, clumsy for users, and prone to supply-chain attacks, making it unreliable for average developers. This as a result leads to the creation of redundant tools and multiple security issues.</p>

<p>We proposed to rewrite the PECL installer, replacing the messy code and the inefficient website.</p>

<p>The result is <a href="https://github.com/php/pie"><strong>ü•ßPIE</strong></a> <strong>(PHP Installer for Extensions)</strong>, a new tool that replaces PECL with a PHP-native toolchain that is easier to maintain and more secure. It relies on the packagist.org infrastructure which is also a native PHP ecosystem.</p>

<p>Follow the progress of <strong>PIE</strong> here: <a href="https://github.com/php/pie">https://github.com/php/pie</a>.</p>

<p>The tool has already gathered a group of <a href="https://github.com/php/pie/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> and was well received in the community:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.codito.dev/2024/11/pie-new-extension-installer-for-php/">Pie: new extension installer for PHP</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phpconference.nl/session/pie-the-phps-next-big-thing/">PIE: The PHP‚Äôs Next Big Thing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sensiolabs.com/blog/2024/introducing-pie-php-extension-installer">Introducing PIE: The Modern PHP Extension Installer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://laravel-news.com/pie">PIE (PHP Installer for Extensions)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We continue investing in PIE in 2025.</p>

<h3 id="web-services-tool-for-php-fpm">Web Services Tool for PHP-FPM</h3>

<p>The Web Services Tool (WST) is a command-line application designed to test PHP-FPM integration across different web servers, environments, and configurations.</p>

<p>Currently, the tool is hosted under a separate GitHub organization (wstool/wst), with plans to move it to the official PHP GitHub organization in the future.</p>

<p>WST has already proven valuable for PHP-FPM development and testing, helping to identify and address complex issues that were previously untested in an automated way.</p>

<p>Learn more in the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/21/web-services-tool-for-php-fpm/">introductory blog post</a>.</p>

<h3 id="security-audit">Security Audit</h3>

<p>We conducted the first external security audit of the PHP core source code in over a decade. The audit is organized in partnership with <a href="https://ostif.org/"><strong>OSTIF</strong></a> and performed by <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/"><strong>Quarkslab</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The public report is currently pending and will be published on <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">The PHP Foundation website</a> once available.</p>

<h3 id="documentation-improvements">Documentation Improvements</h3>

<p>We made multiple incremental improvements to the PHP documentation and also conducted a security review of the docs. Like the source code audit, this review was organized in partnership with <a href="https://ostif.org/"><strong>OSTIF</strong></a> and performed by <a href="https://www.quarkslab.com/"><strong>Quarkslab</strong></a>. As the scope here was too huge, we had to be smart and limit the review to certain most impactful pages.</p>

<p>Additionally, a new Wasm-based PHP runner has been included allowing all code example blocks to be executed directly on the page thanks to <a href="https://les-tilleuls.coop/en">Les-Tilleuls.coop</a>. Further improvements have been made since then, by fixing more examples and including resources to make the XML extensions' examples work..</p>

<p>An auto-cleaner script has also been added that removes comments older than 1 year with a score of &#45;5 or lower.  This has removed around 2000 low-quality notes from the site.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-update">Infrastructure Update</h3>

<p>As part of <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/programs/bug-resilience">The Sovereign Tech Bug Resilience Program</a>, we partnered with <a href="https://neighbourhood.ie/">Neighbourhoodie Software</a> to overhaul the scripts powering parts of PHP‚Äôs web infrastructure, and also set up more appropriate back-ups.
Previously scattered scripts have been consolidated into robust Ansible playbooks. The rollout is currently being planned, and will result in a much easier to maintain and restore the PHP project's infrastructure. In the future, all infrastructure will likely be managed through this.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-staff">The PHP Foundation Staff</h2>

<h3 id="renewing-contracts">Renewing contracts</h3>

<p>In 2023, we had a team of 6 developers. All of them demonstrated a high quality of work, and dedication to the mission of the foundation. We were happy to renew the contracts for 2024 as well as extend the total number of hours for developers requesting it.</p>

<p>We aim to review the rates every year based on the available funding and priorities.</p>

<h3 id="growing-the-team">Growing the Team</h3>

<p>As was mentioned in the previous transparency report, we aimed to extend the team. It did not happen in 2023 because one of the prospective developers could not join the team for personal reasons, and had to step down from PHP core development entirely. Again, this is <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/#the_bus_factor">the Bus Factor at its worst</a>. However, we were able to extend the team starting with 2024&#46;</p>

<p>Initially, we offered the new developers 6-month trial contracts so that the developers and the Governing Board can evaluate the results and then decide whether to continue the engagements. The results were far beyond our expectations. All new developers David Carlier, James Titcumb, Saki Takamachi, and Shivam Mathur demonstrated dedication and brought high value results, and demonstrated value.</p>

<h3 id="why-didn%E2%80%99t-we-add-more-developers%3F">Why didn‚Äôt we add more developers?</h3>

<p>In October 2024, following our usual process, we <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/09/17/application-form-2025/">opened applications</a> to expand or update our development team. We received many applications, including some from highly qualified candidates. However, we ultimately decided not to expand the team this time.</p>

<p><strong>The main reason is simple: budget constraints.</strong></p>

<p>Our funding from sponsorships determines how much we can afford, and we prioritize long-term stability over short-term expansion. Retaining the current team ensures we maintain the compound benefits of accumulated knowledge and experience. Growing the team temporarily, only to downsize later, would be counterproductive.</p>

<p>If we secure additional funding throughout the year, we may revisit the decision to expand the team.</p>

<h3 id="the-team-as-of-2025">The team as of 2025</h3>

<p>Starting from January, we continue contracting 10 developers to work on PHP:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arnaud Le Blanc</strong> <a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">@arnaud-lb</a></li>
<li><strong>David Carlier</strong> <a href="https://github.com/devnexen">@devnexen</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="retrospective%3A-goals-of-2024">Retrospective: Goals of 2024</h2>

<p>In the previous report, we outlined a few organizational and technical goals. Let‚Äôs look back and evaluate the results.</p>

<h3 id="organization-goals">Organization goals</h3>

<p><strong>Onboard new major sponsors ‚ùå‚úÖ</strong><br />
We did have a few new and returning major sponsors, including Laravel, GoDaddy, Manychat. And of course we are happy about ongoing sponsorship from our founding members, and <a href="https://x.com/ThePHPF/status/1853390265429508427">increased commitment from Automattic</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Explore strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities ‚úÖ</strong><br />
We did collaborate with the Sentry team on Open Source Pledge initiative</p>

<p><strong>Further develop the Advisory Board initiative ‚ùå</strong><br />
The Advisory Board played a big role in <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/01/how-hooks-happened/">shaping the Hooks RFC</a>. However, we have much more potential. In 2025, we‚Äôd like to revamp the AB to make it more useful and collaborative.</p>

<p><strong>Grow the foundation's community ‚úÖ</strong><br />
The PHP Foundation Slack is an invite-only community, and its closed nature has helped keep it very productive. We gradually add more community leaders and developers, along with one-channel guests for specific tasks. We also maintain a public channel, <strong>&#35;php-internals</strong>, which is mirrored on the <a href="https://phpc.chat/">PHP Community Discord server</a>.</p>

<h3 id="technical-goals">Technical goals</h3>

<p><strong>Ongoing maintenance and development of the PHP core ‚úÖ</strong></p>

<p><strong>Deliver the STF projects ‚úÖ</strong></p>

<p><strong>Improve the quality of the ideas and RFCs coming from the foundation ‚úÖ</strong><br />
All of the RFCs from The PHP Foundation ‚Äî even major ones like Hooks ‚Äî passed the vote. We see that as a clear sign of the proposals‚Äô quality.</p>

<p><strong>Conduct research and surveys to define priorities ‚ùå‚úÖ</strong><br />
We conducted <a href="https://youtu.be/XE4g1Tl6RQw?si=6zlWRFlyaKnv9cji&amp;t=843">quantitative research</a> in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PhpStorm</a> team and<br />
JetBrains. However, we were unable to conduct a PHP community survey. Nevertheless, we supported <a href="https://www.zend.com/blog/2025-php-survey-launch">Zend by Perforce PHP Landscape Survey</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Develop a high-level roadmap for PHP changes sponsored by the foundation ‚ùå</strong>
The roadmap and vision need further development and discussion. We plan to announce a few strategic moves in the upcoming months.</p>

<h2 id="php-language-impact">PHP Language Impact</h2>

<p>Every day, the PHP Foundation staff team contributes to the open-source repositories of the <a href="https://github.com/php">PHP GitHub organization</a>. The foundation team contributes in many forms: filing issues, reviewing pull requests, participating in discussions on mailing lists, triaging issues, submitting RFC proposals.</p>

<p>In this document, four categories of contributions are presented in more detail: commits to php-src, reviews of pull requests on php-src, submitted RFC documents, and documentation work.</p>

<h3 id="commits-to-php">Commits to PHP</h3>

<p>The following chart summarizes the number of commits made to the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a> repository in 2024&#46;</p>

<h3 id="generics">Generics</h3>

<p>Generics are one of the most requested PHP features, but also the hardest. In 2024, the Foundation funded exploratory research into how generics might be implemented.  The <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/08/19/state-of-generics-and-collections/">result of that research</a> is available in its own blog post. In short, there is potential to make it happen but still some significant performance-related issues to resolve.</p>

<h3 id="release-maintenance">Release Maintenance</h3>

<p>Saki Takamachi, one of the Foundation developers, volunteered to be a release manager for PHP 8.4. The PHP Foundation supported such an initiative.</p>

<p>Jakub Zelenka, another foundation developer, continued duty as a release manager for PHP 8.3. Also supported by the foundation.</p>

<h3 id="security">Security</h3>

<p>The PHP Foundation contributed significantly to the 4 security releases. As per <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-8.1.31/NEWS">PHP 8.1 changelog</a>, most security issues were addressed by Niels Dossche (11), followed by the foundation developers Jakub Zelenka (6) and Arnaud Le Blanc (1). There has been additional work done in terms of reviews and release preparations.</p>

<p>In addition, various documentation security issues were fixed by the foundation developers as result of the security audit.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-and-the-eu-cyber-resilience-act">The PHP Foundation and the EU Cyber Resilience Act</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation is now a founding member of the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/04/02/open-source-community-cra-compliance-initiative/">Cyber Resilience Act Working Group</a>, giving us a key role in monitoring developments, representing PHP‚Äôs interests, and ensuring compliance with the regulation.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2025/report-2024/eu_cra_wg.png" alt="EU Cyber Resilience Act Working Group" /></p>

<p>Late last year, the group evolved into the <a href="https://orcwg.org/">Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group</a> (ORCWG). Jakub Zelenka, the Foundation developer, is part of the FAQ task force. That allows us to play an advisory role and help prepare the PHP ecosystem for the regulations.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2025/report-2024/open-source-pledge-logo-sticker.svg" width="400" alt="Open Source Pledge"/></p>

<p>In 2024, Sentry launched the <a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/">Open Source Pledge</a>, with the aim of encouraging companies that rely on Open Source systems to help directly fund Open Source development.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation is also <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/08/open-source-pledge/">a supporter of this effort</a>; contributing to Open Source is its entire purpose.  The Foundation also <a href="https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/">welcomes sponsorships</a> from companies and organizations that wish to support Open Source as part of their Pledge.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-brand-%26-public-channels">The PHP Foundation brand &amp; public channels</h2>

<h2 id="goals-for-2025">Goals for 2025</h2>

<p>Our foremost mission remains the same: <strong>maintain and develop the PHP language</strong>. We‚Äôd like PHP to be the best platform for users and for businesses creating web applications and APIs.</p>

<p>The main challenge for continuing the work of The PHP Foundation is to ensure sustainable sponsorship.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, the goal is to ensure that foundation developers work on valuable tasks.</p>

<h3 id="organization-goals">Organization Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Secure funding to support core development and marketing initiatives.</li>
<li>Launch the "PHP 30" anniversary campaign in collaboration with JetBrains.</li>
<li>Consolidate and grow social media presence across multiple platforms.</li>
<li>Increase website traffic through improved documentation and resources.</li>
<li>Develop an Ambassador Program.</li>
<li>Begin preparation for the "PHP Next" marketing campaign to highlight PHP's modernization.</li>
<li>Modernize PHP's website with updated downloads page, documentation, and homepage.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-goals">Technical Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continue on-going maintenance and development of the PHP core.</li>
<li>Establish a working group for integrating modern HTTP server capabilities into PHP core.</li>
<li>Address key developer experience pain points, particularly for first-time users.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="budget-plan-for-2025">Budget plan for 2025</h2>

<p>In 2025, we adjusted the developers‚Äô hours according to their availability, requests, and our budget restrictions.</p>

<p>With this plan, we estimate our annual spending cap at approximately <strong>$900,000</strong> for developer compensation.</p>

<p>Our collaboration with the OpenCollective platform has been positive, and we plan to continue operating under the umbrella of the Open Source Collective in 2025&#46; This means that sponsorships we receive are reduced by 10% for Open Source Collective fees and 0-5% for payment processing fees.</p>

<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>

<p>The PHP language is a living entity and, as such, requires continuous support to address developer issues, resolve security vulnerabilities, and has to evolve to meet the needs of the future.</p>

<p>Based on the strong third year of the foundation, we are excited to continue and multiply the efforts in the next years.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/"><strong>your help</strong></a>, we continue the mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP language.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow. Can you believe it? Just three years (and one day) ago, PHP had no organization behind it. Only two people were being paid to work on the language that powers 70% of the web.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the very first announcement about the creation of the PHP Foundation: 
<a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/">The New Life of PHP ‚Äì The PHP Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fast-forward-to-today">Fast forward to today</h2>

<p>We now have a team of 10 talented engineers dedicated to PHP. We‚Äôre supported by major companies, governments, and an incredible community. That same community is creating amazing projects with PHP, while businesses continue to thrive thanks to a mature, secure, and performant language.</p>

<p>Since 2021, we‚Äôve seen three PHP releases‚ÄîPHP 8.2, 8.3, and the freshly released <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.4/en.php">PHP 8.4</a>. Here are just a few highlights from these releases, developed by the PHP Foundation team:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property hooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/asymmetric-visibility-v2">Asymmetric Visibility</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/lazy-objects">Lazy Objects</a></li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/support_object_type_in_bcmath">Support object type in BCMath</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/saner-inc-dec-operators">Saner Increment/Decrement operators</a></li>
<li>Multiple type system improvements: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null-false-standalone-types">null and false as stand-alone types</a>, <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dnf_types">Disjunctive Normal Form Types</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="feature-development-is-only-about-20%25-of-what-the-foundation-team-does">Feature development is only about 20% of what the foundation team does</h2>

<p>Behind the scenes, there‚Äôs a lot more: triaging and fixing issues, handling security reports, reviewing code, updating documentation, and maintaining infrastructure. All of this work empowers the community and ensures PHP is stable and reliable.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The total contributions to the PHP repositories grew by 51+%</li>
<li>We conducted the first external security audit for PHP in 10 years</li>
<li>We extended security support for PHP versions by one year</li>
<li>We improved CI and testing infrastructure</li>
<li>We introduced automated benchmarks to track performance regressions</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this would be possible without our sponsors. Huge thanks to every company and individual who has supported us over the past three years!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are thrilled to announce that after a year of hard work, dedication, and collaboration, <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.4/"><strong>PHP 8.4</strong></a> is officially here!</p>

<p>Thanks to the tireless efforts of the PHP Foundation members, the core PHP development team, and an incredible community of contributors, this upcoming version brings major new features and syntax, performance and security enhancements, and a healthy amount of deprecations.</p>

<h2 id="a-year-of-hard-work-and-collaboration">A Year of Hard Work and Collaboration</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation financially supports ten PHP core developers. The PHP Foundation members, along with a total of <strong>115 contributors</strong>, have made over <strong>2,600 commits</strong> since PHP 8.3 until PHP 8.4.0 release.</p>

<p>PHP 8.4 includes changes from <strong>36 RFCs</strong>. There have also been numerous mailing list discussions and RFCs that were withdrawn, declined, or are still under discussion.</p>

<p>Since PHP 8.0, PHP 8.4 received the highest number of RFCs, and PHP 8.4 brings the changes such as property hooks and asymmetric visibility that received significant community involvement and refinement.</p>

<h2 id="what-php-8.4-brings">What PHP 8.4 Brings</h2>

<p>PHP 8.4 brings numerous new features and improvements to PHP. We covered some of them in our <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/02/php-core-roundup-19">previous post</a> as well, but they are mentioned here as well, for more complete picture.</p>

<p>As we also covered in <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/02/php-core-roundup-19">PHP Core Roundup #19</a>, Property Hooks and Asymmetric Visibility are two of the highlighted features in PHP 8.4</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="php-8.4-supports-property-hooks%21">PHP 8.4 supports Property Hooks!</h3>

<p>In PHP 8.4, it is possible for a class to declare class properties with "hooks", that get executed when the property is accessed or set, and the hooks can access the object context.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.property-hooks.php">Property hooks</a> open up a wide range of use cases that allow classes to declare virtual properties that enable expressive and intuitive APIs, make code readable and simple and avoid boilerplate code.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {

    public string $emailAddress {
        set {
            if (!filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
                throw new ValueError('emailAddress property must be a valid email address');
            }
            $this-&gt;emailAddress = $value;
        }
    }

}

$user = new User();
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'test@example.com'; // Allowed  
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'not an email address'; // Throws ValueError  
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Crell">Larry Garfield</a> wrote in <a href="/blog/2024/11/01/how-hooks-happened/">PHP 8.4: How Property Hooks Happened</a> about how he and Ilija Tovilo üíú brought Property Hooks to PHP.</p>

<h3 id="asymmetric-visibility">Asymmetric Visibility</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 introduces <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php#language.oop5.visibility-members-aviz">asymmetric visibility</a>, allowing different access levels for getting and setting class properties. This feature is useful when you want to expose a property for reading but not writing.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {  
 public private(set) int $userId;  
 public function __construct() { $this-&gt;userId = 42; }  
}  

$user = new User();  
echo $user-&gt;userId; // 42  

$user-&gt;userId = 16; // Error: Cannot modify private(set) property  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="lazy-objects">Lazy Objects</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 brings support for Lazy Objects. Using the Reflection API, it is possible to create class instances in PHP 8.4 that they are initialized only if needed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.lazy-objects.php">Lazy Objects documentation</a> provides detailed examples and use cases.</p>

<h3 id="html5-compliant-parser-in-dom-extension">HTML5-compliant parser in DOM Extension</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 upgrades the DOM extension with HTML5-compliant parsing. The new <code>Dom\HTMLDocument</code> and <code>Dom\XMLDocument</code> classes replace libxml2, which previously lacked HTML5 support. These updates improve DOM spec compliance and add features like CSS selector support.</p>

<h3 id="bcmath-adds-operator-overloaded-%60bcmath%5Cnumber%60-class">BCMath adds operator-overloaded <code>BcMath\Number</code> class</h3>

<p>The BCMath extension now includes the <code>BcMath\Number</code> class, enabling operator overloading for arithmetic operations.</p>

<pre><code class="php">use BcMath\Number;  

$num1 = new Number('22');  
$num2 = new Number('7');  
$num3 = new Number('100');  

$result = ($num1 / $num2) + $num1 - $num2;  
echo $result; // 18.1428571428
</code></pre>

<p>You can now use standard operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>) with <code>BcMath\Number</code> objects, which also support all <code>bc*</code> functions.</p>

<p>These objects are immutable and implement the <code>Stringable</code> interface, so they can be used in string contexts like <code>echo $num</code>.</p>

<h3 id="new-functions">New Functions</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/array_find"><code>array_find</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/array_find_key"><code>array_find_key</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/array_any"><code>array_any</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/array_all"><code>array_all</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/bcdivmod"><code>bcdivmod</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/bcround"><code>bcround</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/bcceil"><code>bcceil</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/bcfloor"><code>bcfloor</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/mb_trim"><code>mb_trim</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/mb_ltrim"><code>mb_ltrim</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/mb_rtrim"><code>mb_rtrim</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/mb_ucfirst"><code>mb_ucfirst</code></a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/mb_lcfirst"><code>mb_lcfirst</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/grapheme_str_split"><code>grapheme_str_split</code></a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="pdo-driver-specific-subclasses">PDO Driver-Specific Subclasses</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pdo_driver_specific_subclasses">PDO Driver-specific subclasses</a> RFC is implemented in PHP 8.4. Previously, it was voted for PHP 8.3 but was not implemented in PHP 8.3 before its feature-freeze.</p>

<p>PHP 8.4 now adds <code>Pdo\Mysql</code>, <code>Pdo\Pgsql</code>, <code>Pdo\Sqlite</code>, <code>Pdo\DbLib</code>, and <code>Pdo\Firebird</code> classes that extend the <code>PDO</code> class. Driver-specific methods, properties, and constants are now available in the driver-specific subclass. Driver-specific sub classes also allow APIs to be more expressive and restrictive by allowing the functions and methods only to accept/return driver-specific sub-classes.</p>

<h3 id="%60aegis-128l%60-and-%60aegis256%60-support-in-sodium-extension"><code>AEGIS-128L</code> and <code>AEGIS256</code> support in Sodium extension</h3>

<p><strong>AEGIS</strong> is an AES-based family of authenticated encryption algorithms that is faster than AES-GCM. The Sodium extension in PHP 8.4 supports <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sodium-crypto-aead-aegis128l-encrypt.php"><code>AEGIS-128L</code></a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sodium-crypto-aead-aegis256-encrypt.php"><code>AEGIS256</code></a> encryption algorithms if the Sodium extension is compiled with <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium"><code>libsodium</code></a> 1.0.19 or later.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Apart from the new features, PHP 8.4 also updates several underlying dependencies and datasets, as well as unbundling three extensions:</p>

<h3 id="updated-dependencies">Updated dependencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Curl extension now requires libcurl 7.61.0 or later, and even capable of making HTTP/3 requests if it is compiled with a supporting TLS library.</li>
<li>The PCRE extension ships with PCRE 10.44, which provides support for Unicode 15 characters and character blocks, improved Regular Expression syntax, and performance improvements on certain systems.</li>
<li>OpenSSL extension now requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later, with improved support for OpenSSL 3.x series. It can now support Curve25519 and Curve448 based keys. Further, OpenSSL can be compiled to provide Argon2 password hashing on OpenSSL 3.2+ on PHP NTS builds.</li>
<li>To compile PHP as an Apache module (<code>mod_php</code>), PHP 8.4 drops support for the EOL Apache 2.0 and 2.2 series. The minimum required Apache version is now 2.4.</li>
<li>The zlib extension now requires zlib version 1.2.11 at minimum.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unbundled-extensions">Unbundled Extensions</h3>

<p><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unbundle_imap_pspell_oci8">IMAP, Pspell, OCI8, and PDO_OCI8 extensions</a> are unbundled from the PHP core, and are now available as PECL extensions, for which <a href="/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/">PIE might help</a> to install easily.</p>

<h3 id="updated-php-icon-on-windows">Updated PHP Icon on Windows</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 also brings a minor, yet <em>very</em> overdue change to the PHP icon on Windows executables:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th align="center"></th>
  <th align="center"></th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
  <td align="center"><img src="/assets/post-images/2024/php84/php-icon-old.png" alt="old PHP logo in Windows php.exe" /></td>

<h2 id="looking-ahead%3A-php-8.4-and-beyond">Looking Ahead: PHP 8.4 and Beyond</h2>

<p>PHP 8.4 is the first major new PHP releases since the adoption of the new <a href="/blog/2024/10/02/php-core-roundup-19/#php-release-cycle-updates">PHP maintenance policy</a>. PHP 8.4, along with all current active PHP versions, will receive two years of active support and two years of security fixes.</p>

<p>What this means is that PHP 8.4 will receive bug fixes until the end of 2026 and security fixes until the end of 2028.</p>

<p>We just announced the pre-release of <a href="/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/">PIE - PHP Installer for Extensions</a>. PIE will significantly improve the workflow of downloading and compiling PHP extensions.</p>

<p>PHP 8.5 (in the <code>master</code> branch) is currently under active development, and we already have RFCs such as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures_in_const_expr">Support Closures in constant expressions</a> in voting phase, and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api">Add RFC3986 and WHATWG compliant URI parsing support</a> under discussion.</p>

<h2 id="get-ready-to-upgrade">Get Ready to Upgrade</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/releases/tag/php-8.4.1">PHP 8.4.1 is now a tagged release</a> on PHP's GitHub repository.</p>

            <link href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/"/>
            <updated>2024-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're thrilled to introduce the pre-release of the PHP Installer for Extensions (PIE) ‚Äì <a href="https://github.com/php/pie"><strong>github.com/php/pie</strong></a>!</p>

<p>PIE aims to simplify managing PHP extensions by providing a modern, flexible alternative to PECL and treating extensions as first-class citizens in the PHP ecosystem.</p>

<blockquote>
PIE development is commissioned by the <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/tech/php"><strong>Sovereign Tech Agency</strong></a>.
</blockquote>

<p>This initial pre-release is available as a <a href="https://github.com/php/pie/releases/tag/0.2.0">PHAR download</a>, and we invite you to take it for a spin and share your feedback. While this release is an exciting milestone, we know there's a lot more work ahead to make PIE ready for widespread use, so your feedback is invaluable. If you encounter any issues, or have any questions, feel free to open an <a href="https://github.com/php/pie/issues">issue on GitHub</a>, and help us shape the future of PIE.</p>

<h2 id="why-pie%3F">Why PIE?</h2>

<p>With PIE, the process of managing PHP extensions becomes more streamlined. Extensions are distributed via <a href="https://packagist.org/extensions">Packagist</a> just like regular PHP packages! It makes the installation and update process quite familiar if you already use Composer.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre working to make PIE stronger and easier to use. We‚Äôre improving how PHP extensions are managed and using ideas from Composer to make the process smoother.</p>

<h2 id="are-you-an-extension-author%3F">Are you an extension author?</h2>

<p>Extensions do need to be made compatible with PIE by adding a <code>composer.json</code> (more instructions <a href="https://github.com/php/pie/blob/main/docs/extension-maintainers.md">here</a>), and submitting it to <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/submit">Packagist</a>. Once a package has added support for PIE, it will appear on the Packagist <a href="https://packagist.org/extensions">Extensions list</a> page.</p>

            <link href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/01/how-hooks-happened/"/>
            <updated>2024-11-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/01/how-hooks-happened/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PHP 8.4 is coming on 21 November this year.  It includes a host of new functionality, but the biggest, in more ways than one, is Property hooks.  Given the excitement around it, as well as its size, the PHP Foundation's Roman Pronsky asked me to write up a bit about the process we went through to produce this beast.</p>

<p>What eventually became the twin RFCs of Property Hooks and Asymmetric Visibility is actually a very old discussion.  We'll look back at the decade-plus saga that got us here, how Ilija Tovilo and I got sucked in, how the design came to be, and how we managed to get it across the finish line.  Here's a teaser: It would not have happened without the PHP Foundation.</p>

<h2 id="ancient-history">Ancient history</h2>

<p>Ilija and I were not the first RFC to propose "property accessors," as they're called in most languages.  In fact, our RFC was the fifth:</p>

<ol>
<li>2009: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/propertygetsetsyntax">Property get/set syntax</a> by Dennis Robinson.  The core concepts and arguments behind it are all there, and haven't really changed in 15 years.  It never went to a vote.</li>
<li>2012: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/propertygetsetsyntax-v1.2">Property get/set syntax v1.2</a> by Clint Priest and Nikita Popov.  It didn't pass the 2/3 threshold for a vote, but did pass 50%.</li>
<li>2013: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/propertygetsetsyntax-alternative-typehinting-syntax">Property get/set syntax alternate typehinting syntax</a>, by Nikita Popov.  An alternate approach that proved very unpopular, failing 3 to 12.  However, it included a shorthand syntax that looks suspiciously like what eventually became property types.</li>
<li>2021: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property_accessors">Property Accessors</a> by Nikita Popov. More of a brainstorm of what property accessors could be, including specific use-case options like <code>lazy</code> or <code>guard</code>.  It never went to a vote, but Nikita did note that "We could likely get 80% of the value of accessors by supporting read-only properties and 90% by also supporting private-write properties."  (I don't fully agree, but much of the value is in private-write.)</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these attempts had a few things in common:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pseudo-functions that live on properties and intercept get/set operations.</li>
<li>Asymmetric visibility</li>
<li>Interface properties</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-new-team-enters-the-arena">A new team enters the arena</h2>

<p>Fast forward to the summer of 2022.  Ilija Tovilo decided he wanted to take a swing at accessors next, and approached me for help.  Ilija and I had already worked together on the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/enumerations">Enums RFC</a>, so we knew we worked well together.  In part, that's because we have very different skill sets.  Ilija is rapidly becoming one of the most PHP engine-knowledgeable people around and quite proficient at writing C code, but is, by his own admission, not the most proficient writer of English.  I am a weirdo who enjoys language research, designing away edge cases, and can type fast enough to keep up with the Internals mailing list.  We complement each other well.</p>

<p>Illija is also fully funded by the PHP Foundation to work on the engine, without which this amount of work would have been impossible.  I work on a volunteer basis, and as my employers allow.</p>

<p>(Side note: As of this writing, I am between jobs.  If you're looking for a highly-experienced PHP Staff/Principal Engineer with experience in design, architecture, and leading teams, please <a href="https://github.com/Crell/">reach out</a> and let's talk!)</p>

<h2 id="research%2C-then-development">Research, then development</h2>

<p>With the initial goal of "making Nikita's proposal work-ish," I started digging into the research and design side.  My <a href="https://github.com/Crell/php-rfcs/blob/master/property-hooks/research.md">initial brainstorming</a> shows where our thoughts were at the time.  In short:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are two models of accessors: In untyped languages without visibility controls&mdash;like JavaScript and Python&mdash;accessors are methods with funny syntax.  In typed languages with visibility controls&mdash;like C#, Swift, and Kotlin&mdash;accessors are enhancements to a defined property.  As PHP is, let's face it, a typed language with visibility controls, that was clearly the model to follow (as had all previous RFCs).</li>
<li>Yes, we really would need asymmetric visibility, accessors, and interface properties.  While technically separate features, they make the most sense in combination.</li>
<li>The whole scope would be huge, so we needed to break it up where we could.  Splitting Asymmetric visibility off to its own RFC was the most natural place, which would be made easier by using Swift's <code>private(set)</code> style syntax.</li>
</ul>

<p>So in August of 2022 we put forward the first <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/asymmetric-visibility">asymmetric visibility</a> RFC.  Given there was already a clear appetite for such functionality based on list discussions and on the recent <code>readonly</code> addition, which Nikita explicitly intended as a "junior asymmetric visibility," we expected some bikeshedding but overall a straightforward process.</p>

<p>Boy were we wrong.</p>

<h2 id="asymmetric-support">Asymmetric support</h2>

<p>The Asymmetric Visibility RFC was far more contentious than we expected. Some people hated the idea.  Some wouldn't accept anything but the C#-style syntax.  We ran a poll of various different approaches, and our initial proposal (Swift-style placement and syntax) ended up winning by a slim margin, but disappointingly "the consensus position isn't your position, sorry" didn't really persuade anyone.</p>

<p>Eventually, Asymmetric visibility finally went down in a 14:12 vote in January of 2023.  RFCs need 2/3 majorities to pass, so 14:12, while a simple majority, isn't enough.</p>

<h2 id="hooking-it-up">Hooking it up</h2>

<p>The failure of asymmetric visibility was a blow to both of us.  In most cases we didn't even know why the people who voted "no" did so, which made addressing their concerns guesswork.  Had we just wasted our time?  Would accessors even be acceptable?  The current RFC process is very bad at providing that kind of actionable feedback.</p>

<p>While no one from the Foundation mentioned it, we were also both acutely aware that Ilija had been working on paid time for a proposal that ended up failing.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we had split the RFC in two deliberately so that even if only one was successful there was still a benefit.  We therefore turned our attention to the accessor part of the proposal (which included interface properties) and continued working.</p>

<p>The model we developed was essentially a "direct port from Swift, with a few slight renames."</p>

<p>The initial design included:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>get</code> - Totally takes over reading, and there's no physical property created.</li>
<li><code>set</code> - Totally takes over writing, and there's no physical property created.</li>
<li><code>beforeSet</code> - Intercepts the writing of a property but doesn't change the actual write itself.</li>
<li><code>afterSet</code> - Called after the property is written, doesn't change the actual write itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is also when we changed the name from "accessors" to "hooks," which seemed a more accurate description given that model.  This later ended up not making sense, but Ilija had already taken the time to rename everything in the patch, so it was too much work to change back.  Sorry.</p>

<p>The RFC text itself grew and grew.  PHP is a very mature (read: complex) language, and so there were lots of nooks and crannies that we had to account for.  Properties touch on almost everything: References, arrays, inheritance, final properties, interfaces, interaction with <code>readonly</code>, interaction with <code>__get</code>/<code>__set</code>, serialization, constructor property promotion, reflection...</p>

<p>PHP is a big language, and we needed to think through and implement every possible edge case to avoid booby traps.</p>

<h2 id="some-very-good-advice">Some very good Advice</h2>

<p>We finally had a working design and implementation by April 2023 or so, but were quite nervous about it.  It was big, and we were both still smarting from the loss of asymmetric visibility.  Roman suggested that he run it past the PHP Foundation's Advisory Board for feedback first before going to the list, which turned out to be the best thing we could do.</p>

<p>The Board came back with mostly positive feedback; they liked the concept, the design, the detail... but having 4 separate hooks felt very clumsy to them.  Especially with get/set wiping the backing property entirely and leaving the developer on their own.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The PHP Foundation's Advisory Board</strong> serves as a vital bridge between our major sponsors and the PHP development community. It's a Slack channel where we share early updates, insights, and ask for feedback. As well as receive insights and queries from sponsors' representatives. <br><br>

Companies interested in joining this influential group and directly contributing to the future of PHP can become members of the Advisory Board by contributing a minimum of $12,000 to The&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;Foundation as at least a Silver Sponsor. <br/><br/>

<strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/">Learn more about sponsorship opportunities.</a></strong><br/>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't have the original chat log, but that resulted in a brief exchange that went approximately like this:</p>

<pre><code class="text">Roman: The Advisory Board says three different set-ish hooks are a problem  
Larry: Well, we kinda have to, because you can't access a property 
       from within its own hook, that doesn't make sense.  
Ilija: Er, actually we could do that easily.  
Larry: Wait, what?  That... how... why...  
Larry: *does some research*  
Larry: Well crap, that's exactly what Kotlin does.  
       Why didn't we research Kotlin in the first place?  
Ilija: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
Ilija: Well, I just switched it over to that. Looks nicer.
</code></pre>

<p>And so there we were, with half as many syntaxes for the same functionality, and a feature name (hooks) that no longer made sense.  Oh well.</p>

<p>We finally made a public proposal at the start of May 2023.  Initial feedback was quite positive, though there was some pushback, including around the syntax from people who wanted the Javascript/Python style (naturally).  And the length.  Oh, the length.  If hooks isn't the longest RFC ever proposed, it's close.  But as we reiterated many times, that's because the problem space itself is highly complex.</p>

<p>Sadly, time was not on our side.  Ilija was still working out some implementation edge cases and PHP 8.3‚Äôs feature-freeze was rapidly approaching.  So in early July, almost exactly a year after we started working on it, we decided to postpone hooks until 8.4 to give such a large change enough time to settle in and get adjusted if needed.</p>

<h2 id="take-2">Take 2</h2>

<p>After many distractions, we were able to bring the topic back up in <a href="https://externals.io/message/122445">February of 2024</a>, with the intent to bring it to a vote quickly, in March.  (We were so naive.)</p>

<p>There was a lot more discussion this time around, though a lot of it was re-hashing edge cases we'd already addressed.  We also spent a considerable amount of time talking with the Foundation's developer team.  They, by and large, represent the most experienced developers of PHP Internals today, and were an invaluable resource.  That we could talk to them in real time via the Foundation's private chat also helped, as that's a far easier way to handle back-and-forth than a mailing list.</p>

<p>There were a few significant changes we did end up making in response to feedback, from both the list and the Foundation team.  Most importantly, Ilija managed to make array properties work, which had been a challenge due to references.  Once again, being able to attack the problem from two directions (design and ergonomics from me, implementation from Ilija) let us improve the overall experience dramatically.</p>

<h2 id="down-to-the-wire">Down to the wire</h2>

<p>Even then, with all the positive feedback, it wasn't clear to us if it would pass.  Many people on the list had expressed support, but a lot of them were non-voters.</p>

<p>Others had expressed essentially "fearful support"; They liked the idea, couldn't find fault with the implementation, but were concerned about just how big and complex the feature was.</p>

<p>Still others, for various reasons, suggested moving certain sub-features to a separate, future RFC. Which is often code for "I don't like this part, but I don't want to vote against the RFC because of it, so please let me vote against it separately."  We explained, repeatedly, that this was already the slimmed down, partial version.  The other part was asymmetric visibility.</p>

<p>After a lot of discussion and with a lot of trepidation, we called the vote in mid-April of 2024.  It passed 42:2.  I don't understand PHP Internals at times.</p>

<h2 id="asymmetric-visibility-2%3A-the-wrath-of-ilija">Asymmetric Visibility 2: The Wrath of Ilija</h2>

<p>Several people pointed out that hooks without asymmetric visibility had significant holes in it.  They were right, which is why we'd originally proposed that first.  We had decided that if hooks pass, we would take a second swing at asymmetric visibility.  So we did.</p>

<p>The only actionable feedback we'd gotten the first time around was that without support for combining <code>readonly</code> and asymmetric visibility, the RFC felt "incomplete."  We went through a few variations on how to address that before landing on the final solution: Change <code>readonly</code> from being implicitly <code>private(set)</code> to implicitly <code>protected(set)</code>.  Otherwise, the discussion was mostly a retread of the year before.</p>

<p>We were still stressing out about this one, too.  It hadn't passed before, why would it now?  However, this time it passed 24:7 at the start of August 2024.</p>

<p>Looking at the results, while there were two people who changed from a No to a Yes, the biggest change from the first vote was simply who voted.  Most of the previous No votes... didn't vote this time.  But entirely new people showed up to vote yes.  Showing up to vote matters, folks.</p>

<h2 id="on-to-the-next-adventure">On to the next adventure</h2>

<p>25 months after the process started, PHP now joins the cadre of languages with robust, flexible properties that can do more than just hold dumb values.  It's been a wild ride, and at many points a needlessly stressful one.  The end result, though, is a host of powerful new features that make PHP 8.4 the most exciting PHP release in several years.  Really, they're the best thing since enums...</p>

<p>I hope this tale is a useful insight for folks into how the sausage is made.  Now go enjoy interface properties, hooks, and asymmetric visibility.  Or enjoy not using hooks, but having the option to, which eliminates a lot of code.  Both work.</p>

            <id>https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/21/web-services-tool-for-php-fpm/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Web Services Tool (WST) is a command-line application developed to test PHP-FPM, <a href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/php"><strong>commissioned by the Sovereign Tech Fund</strong></a> (STF). Its primary goal is to facilitate testing of the integration between different web servers and PHP-FPM across various environments and configurations.</p>

<p>This blog post provides an introduction to the tool. We'll go through the history of PHP-FPM testing and the reasons that led to WST's development. The post also outlines the project structure, insights into the tool‚Äôs architecture, its current state, and the roadmap for future development.</p>

<h2 id="php-fpm-testing-and-wst-history">PHP-FPM testing and WST history</h2>

<h3 id="first-steps">First steps</h3>

<p>PHP-FPM was initially developed as a patch series starting around 2004. It evolved into a more modular architecture with a separate SAPI by 2009, and it was <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/06b9943842eb954025ac83b542e97d6310aa524a">merged into the PHP core</a> in 2010. It was declared stable with the release of PHP 5.4 in 2011. While this version introduced many features that are still used today, it did not include any automated tests; all testing was done manually.</p>

<p>The first automated test was introduced in early 2014, and it provided a basic check to verify that PHP-FPM can start with a certain configuration. Later that year, more advanced tests were added, including a FastCGI client, which allowed PHP-FPM to run in a separate process, accept FastCGI requests, and return responses. This was a major step forward, as it enabled testing scenarios that weren't previously possible. However, the implementation was more of a workaround, piecing together different components. The tests were repetitive and limited in their ability to define complex expectations.</p>

<h3 id="a-bit-more%2C-but-still-not-enough">A bit more, but still not enough</h3>

<p>In 2018, I <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/ea592e6b6c43b7c5ebedf63254b8088f741e276c">carried out</a> a complete rewrite of the FPM tests, introducing a primary <code>Tester</code> class. This class integrated more robust expectations and added abstractions for handling requests and responses. Over the years, this framework has been improved and now includes many features that support testing more complex scenarios. It significantly improves test code re-usability and offers various new options for easier testing. However, it <strong>doesn‚Äôt cover integration tests with web servers</strong>, which often have quirks not easily caught by these tests. Additionally, this framework <strong>doesn't handle high-load scenarios</strong>, which are necessary for testing process management in PHP-FPM. <strong>This showed the need for a new tool to keep PHP-FPM development safe.</strong></p>

<h3 id="here-comes-the-php-foundation-and-the-stf-service-agreement">Here comes The PHP Foundation and the STF service agreement</h3>

<p>Initially, I had an idea to extend <a href="https://github.com/bukka/fpmt">fpmt</a>, my tool for testing PHP-FPM (specifically for sending custom FastCGI requests), and integrate most of the testing logic directly into it. However, it soon became clear that maintaining such a tool would require constant code changes, and the effort needed to build and sustain it was too large. As a result, I put the project on hold.</p>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt until 2023 that the idea resurfaced, thanks to an opportunity provided by the Sovereign Tech Fund. The STF gave PHP projects a chance to propose initiatives aimed at improving their overall health. Testing, being a critical component of project health, made this tool a perfect candidate, and it, along with <a href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/php#what-are-we-funding">three other projects</a>, comprised the scope of work commissioned by the STF.</p>

<h3 id="how-wst-started">How WST started</h3>

<p>I began the work on the tool in January 2024 with the planning phase. It quickly became evident that a more generic approach would offer greater flexibility and cover more use cases. I decided to design the tool around a clear configuration structure, which would be parsed and executed. A key part of the planning was ensuring that the <strong>same tests could run both locally and in containers</strong>, with an option to simulate high loads by integrating with a load testing tool. Given these requirements, I chose Go as the implementation language, as it provides well-supported clients and packages for all the project‚Äôs needs. Go's advanced templating capabilities, which are popular in tools like Helm, were also a deciding factor.</p>

<p>For easier setup, the project was organized under a new <a href="https://github.com/wstool/"><strong>wstool</strong></a> organization, containing two repositories: one for the actual tool implementation (<a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst">wst</a>) and another for the PHP-FPM testing configurations (<a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst-php-fpm">wst-php-fpm</a>). The structure of the application differs slightly from typical Go applications, as it focuses on achieving full test coverage for most components. As a result, it features multiple sub-packages to allow for the creation of mocks using <a href="https://github.com/vektra/mockery">Go Mockery</a>, which generates <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">Testify</a> mocks.</p>

<h2 id="the-current-state-and-its-structure">The current state and its structure</h2>

<p>The tool has been developed into a functional state that allows it to run various tests. Its architecture is defined by its configuration, with a strong emphasis on flexibility.</p>

<p>At the core of the configuration is a file that contains a specification composed of settings for various components. Multiple configuration files can be specified, along with specific overrides for selected values. These configurations and overrides are then merged into a single, unified configuration. Example of execution could look like:</p>

<pre><code class="shell">wst -f /path/to/cfg1 -f /path/to/cfg2 -o spec.defaults.service.sandbox=docker
</code></pre>

<p>This will merge cfg1 and cfg2 and apply overwrite for the default server.<br />
The final configuration defines environments, sandboxes, servers, and instances ‚Äì these are the core elements of the application‚Äôs execution. Additionally, it defines some default settings, including base parameters. These parameters allow for further customization and can be accessed within template files and strings. The example of primary configuration looks like</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">version: "0.1"
name: FPM
description: FPM server specifications for testing PHP-FPM
spec:
  environments: environments.yaml
  instances: spec/instances/*.yaml
  sandboxes: sandboxes.yaml
  servers: servers/*/*/server.yaml
  workspace: workspace/
  defaults:
    service:
      sandbox: local
    parameters:
      fpm_binary: php-fpm
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, it is possible to separate config to multiple files that can be specified in the wildcard format. The meaning of primary spec parts is following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Environments</strong> specify where the tests are executed, allowing for tests to run locally, in Docker, or Kubernetes environments. This enables testing across different distributions using Docker and under production-like loads with Kubernetes. Such flexibility helps recreate reported issues more effectively, as some problems only appear under heavy load. It also provides greater confidence when implementing new features or fixing complex bugs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sandboxes</strong> are closely related to environments, defining how services behave in each environment. Specifically, they define hooks containing commands or signals for starting, stopping, reloading, and restarting services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Servers</strong> contain the specifications of the web servers or other web services being tested. They define server configuration templates, expectations, parameters, and specific hooks linked to sandboxes. For instance, a server might specify PHP-FPM configuration files (fpm.conf, php.ini), set up start hooks for the PHP-FPM binary with selected parameters, and outline specific log message expectations following PHP-FPM startup. These predefined settings help reduce code duplication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instances</strong> are the core of WST‚Äôs testing functionality. They define everything specific to a single test case, primarily specifying the service. This means choosing the server by name, providing parameters, and specifying configuration files to be included with the selected parameters. They also define scripts included in the services and their content, which are then utilized during actions.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The mentioned actions offer additional flexibility by providing a custom mini pipeline which offers a high degree of flexibility. Actions are responsible for controlling services (start, stop, restart, reload), triggering requests (request, bench), and setting expectations on output (logs), responses (for requests), and metrics (for benchmarks). There is also a parallel action, allowing multiple actions to run simultaneously</p>

<p>This is an example of a simple instance with actions:</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">version: "0.1"
name: FPM
description: FPM server specifications for testing PHP-FPM
spec:
  environments: environments.yaml
  instances: spec/instances/*.yaml
  sandboxes: sandboxes.yaml
  servers: servers/*/*/server.yaml
  workspace: workspace/
  defaults:
    service:
      sandbox: local
    parameters:
      fpm_binary: php-fpm
</code></pre>

<p>This test starts FPM and <code>httpd</code> with selected configs, sends a request for <code>index.php</code> path, verifies that response body and stops the servers.</p>

<p>Currently, the tool works in a local environment and has already helped recreate complex scoreboard locking issues through its automated load testing (bench action). The Docker and Kubernetes environments have largely been finalized in terms of structure, with most of the implementation in place. However, some additional changes and fixes are needed for full functionality.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-results">The first results</h2>

<p>The initial PHP-FPM configuration includes only a few instances and server configurations. It defines three servers‚Äîfpm, nginx, and httpd (Apache). These servers contain default configurations with all necessary settings, as well as variants for Debian and RedHat that could be used as needed. The servers also define reusable expectations across instances. For PHP-FPM, these expectations are used to verify that the server has started successfully, based on log messages, and include templates for asserting FPM status responses.</p>

<p>As for instances, there are currently the following tests defined:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst-php-fpm/blob/bccec57f02e7918aedf5bce43387a3c1ce733f37/spec/instances/access-suppress-path-status.yaml">Access log path suppression test</a> &#45; It verifies access logs, which uses status checking and output verification to ensure that access logs are properly generated in both PHP-FPM and Nginx.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst-php-fpm/blob/bccec57f02e7918aedf5bce43387a3c1ce733f37/spec/instances/httpd-proxy-fcgi-handler-basic.yaml">Apache httpd mod&#95;proxy&#95;fcgi SetHandler basic tests</a> &#45; It tests FastCGI integration between Apache httpd and PHP-FPM and makes sure that different combinations of test works. It also recreates a recent issue with Apache httpd integration.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wstool/wst-php-fpm/blob/bccec57f02e7918aedf5bce43387a3c1ce733f37/spec/instances/scoreboard-atomic-copy.yaml">Scoreboard atomic copying test</a> &#45; It focuses on testing the scoreboard under higher loads. This test has been particularly useful in reliably reproducing a scoreboard locking issue, which has been causing errors for users. Once the issue is resolved, the test will serve as a regression check to ensure the problem doesn‚Äôt reoccur.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-future-development">The future development</h2>

<p>The primary goal moving forward is to add more tests and begin using the tool to address existing complex issues and features in PHP-FPM. This will require further updates to the application to improve its capabilities. The tool also needs to be stabilized and made more user-friendly, specifically, enhancing logging and documentation.</p>

<p>Once the tool and PHP-FPM tests reach a stable state, the next step would be to set up a continuous integration (CI) system to run all stable tests regularly against the latest repository. Ideally, this could be integrated into PHP‚Äôs nightly workflow. There is a possibility to use higher spec resources from TeamCity or infrastructure provided by AWS to PHP Foundation which is currently used for benchmarking project testing performance of PHP.</p>

<p>Since the tool is not specific to PHP-FPM, it could also be applied to other parts of PHP. For example, it could finally enable tests for the Apache handler (<code>mod_php</code>) SAPI, which is still widely used but currently lacks testing, making changes risky. Additionally, the tool could be useful for testing specific scenarios involving PHP extensions that rely on external services, such as databases or LDAP.</p>

<p>Another area where the tool could be valuable is in performing various security-related tests. Adding fuzzing capabilities could help uncover a range of issues, including potential security vulnerabilities, not only in PHP-FPM but also in the web servers themselves.</p>

<p>Testing full framework applications and automating setup steps like <code>composer install</code> could improve the tool as well. This will require more time and help from the community to make sure the setups are reliable in all environments.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The WST has already proven to be valuable for PHP-FPM development and testing, because it helps address  complex issues which were never tested in automated way before.</p>

<p>As more features and tests are added, its importance will only grow. We hope it will become an essential part of ensuring PHP-FPM's stability, performance, and evolution.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The PHP Foundation is proud to announce our support for the Open Source Pledge initiative, launched by Sentry and its partners. This step addresses the sustainability challenges within the Open Source Software (OSS) community, particularly affecting PHP and its ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="the-open-source-pledge%3A-a-commitment-to-sustainability">The Open Source Pledge: A Commitment to Sustainability</h2>

<p>The Open Source Pledge represents a commitment from member companies to provide meaningful financial support to Open Source maintainers. This initiative aims to prevent maintainer burnout and reduce the risk of high-profile security incidents that can impact the broader tech ecosystem.</p>

<p>The OSS community, including PHP, faces significant challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Security risks:</strong> High-profile incidents like Log4shell, XZ, and Heartbleed have highlighted the potential consequences of under-resourced projects.</li>
<li><strong>Developer burnout:</strong> Many maintainers, often volunteers, are feeling exhausted and leaving the very projects you might be using.</li>
<li><strong>Losing maintainers:</strong> The demanding nature of maintaining open-source software means we‚Äôre seeing fewer contributors over time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation%27s-role">The PHP Foundation's Role</h2>

<p>As the main funder and steward of the PHP language, we‚Äôve seen firsthand how a lack of funding impacts crucial projects. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core language development:</strong> Keeping PHP up to date and improving it takes a lot of time and expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Security support:</strong> Without enough funding, PHP can‚Äôt address vulnerabilities quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Extension maintenance:</strong> Many essential PHP extensions are struggling to find people to maintain them.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation efforts:</strong> Keeping PHP‚Äôs extensive documentation current is always a big challenge.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-join-the-pledge">How to Join the Pledge</h1>

<p>The Open Source Pledge offers a structured approach to supporting OSS with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimum contribution: $2,000 per year, per developer on staff.</li>
<li>Transparency: Companies should publish annual reports detailing their payments.</li>
<li>Direct impact: Funds go directly to maintainers, supporting their crucial work.</li>
</ul>
