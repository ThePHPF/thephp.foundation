<p>This initiative, hosted by the Eclipse Foundation, will focus on creating specifications for secure software development rooted in open source best practices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We hope that our specifications could inform the formal standardisation processes of at least one of the European Standards Organisations. Given the tight time horizon for implementation of the CRA, we believe that this immediate start will provide a constructive environment to host the technical discussions necessary for the stewards, contributors, and adopters of open source to meet the requirements set forth in these new regulations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At The PHP Foundation, we are committed to supporting the open source community, ensuring that the PHP language and its ecosystem are prepared for the upcoming regulatory changes.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>At the beginning of 2024, The PHP Foundation is a collective of <strong>9 volunteer board members</strong>, <strong>1 full-time operations manager</strong> sponsored by JetBrains, and <strong>10 developers</strong> paid part-time/full-time who make more than half of the contributions to the PHP language and its extensions.</p>

<p>In 2023, The PHP Foundation received <strong>$418,669 in financial contributions</strong> from organizations and individuals.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation’s main focus in 2023 was strengthening the maintenance of PHP core, the project that lives in the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a> GitHub repository. This project is the home of the PHP language, where PHP’s interpreter is developed. Everyone who uses PHP benefits in one way or another from the work that is done in this repository.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation demonstrates its growing impact on the language through an increased volume and velocity of code contributions and reviews. The 6 part-time and full-time developers contracted by The PHP Foundation were responsible for nearly half of the commits and reviews made in the PHP language.</p>

<p>Moreover, the foundation's presence and activities have led to heightened interest and activity in the PHP project overall, with the total number of <strong>contributions to the language growing by 79% compared to 2022</strong>.</p>

<p>At the end of 2023, the German government’s <strong>Sovereign Tech Fund chose to invest in The PHP Foundation’s mission</strong> by providing funding for a security audit and other long outstanding projects critical for the PHP ecosystem.</p>

<p>The foundation is <strong>expanding its development efforts in 2024</strong> by contracting 4 additional developers and increasing the number of hours that current contracted developers are working.</p>

<p>The foundation plans to spend up to $1,045,000, including compensation and fees. We are looking for additional sponsor contributions to allow us to continue these efforts in the next years.</p>

<p>In 2024, we aim to achieve the following strategic goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure sustainable sponsorship for the foundation.</li>
<li>Ensure that foundation developers focus on valuable tasks.</li>
<li>Promote PHP within the web development ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-mission">The PHP Foundation Mission</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation was initiated by JetBrains, Automattic, Laravel, Acquia, Zend, Private Packagist, Symfony, Craft CMS, and Tideways. It was publicly <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/">launched</a> on November 22, 2021.</p>

<p>Since 2021, many companies and individuals have joined the initiative. To make the priorities of the foundation more clear and aligned, we’ve <strong>updated the mission statement</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The PHP Foundation’s mission is to ensure the long-term prosperity of the PHP language. The PHP Foundation focuses on providing financial support and guidance to PHP language developers to support its goals of improving the language for its users, providing high-quality maintenance, and improving the PHP language project to retain current contributors and to integrate new contributors. The PHP Foundation aims to promote the public image of the PHP language in the interest of retaining existing and gaining new users and contributors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
So it defines 4 priorities of the foundation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Improve the language for users.</li>
<li>Provide high-quality maintenance.</li>
<li>Improve the project to retain current contributors and to integrate new contributors.</li>
<li>Promote the public image of PHP.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="organizational-growth">Organizational Growth</h2>

<p>Many companies with a vested interest in PHP’s prosperity made a major financial contribution during the year. These are the companies that contributed $10,000 or more in 2023:</p>

<p><strong>JetBrains, Automattic, Private Packagist, Craft CMS, Tideways, pixiv Inc., Mercari Inc., Symfony Corp, Aternos GmbH, Sentry, Ardennes-étape, Zend by Perforce, Les-Tilleuls.coop, Cybozu.</strong></p>

<p>Overall, 718 organizations and individuals sponsored the foundation in 2023 <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation">on Open Collective</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ThePHPF">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-sovereign-tech-fund-investment">The Sovereign Tech Fund Investment</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a> (STF) supports the development, improvement, and maintenance of open digital infrastructure in the public interest. Its goal is to strengthen the open-source ecosystem sustainably, focusing on security, resilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the code. STF is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) and supported by the German Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation GmbH (SPRIND).</p>

<p>We have collaborated with STF to create work plans for these specific projects:</p>

<h4 id="pecl-overhaul">PECL overhaul</h4>

<p>The current system for distributing PHP extensions, PECL/PEAR, is outdated and prone to supply-chain attacks, making it unreliable for average developers. This leads to the creation of redundant tools and new security issues.</p>

<p>We proposed to rewrite the PECL installer, replacing the messy pear code and the inefficient website.</p>

<p>Follow the progress of <strong>the new tool 🥧PIE</strong> here: <a href="https://github.com/ThePHPF/pie-design">https://github.com/ThePHPF/pie-design</a>.</p>

<h4 id="testing-tool-for-fpm">Testing tool for FPM</h4>

<p>Currently, the PHP project's testing framework lacks more specialized support for the automated testing of the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM), especially for issues that require higher load. We propose to develop an FPM/SAPI testing tool that can execute all applications and set expectations on the produced logs and server responses. This tool will be connected with a load testing tool (e.g., wrk) to simulate real-world usage and load.</p>

<p>The work has started in the <a href="https://github.com/bukka/wst">https://github.com/bukka/wst</a> repository with the plan to move it to the PHP GitHub organization when ready.</p>

<h4 id="security-audit">Security Audit</h4>

<p>PHP, like any other language, has its share of security issues. We are going to collaborate with a security research group for a comprehensive codebase audit and address the discovered issues. This will significantly improve the security of PHP and make it more reliable for developers and businesses.</p>

<p>The audit is being organized in partnership with <a href="https://ostif.org/">OSTIF</a>.</p>

<h4 id="documentation-improvements">Documentation improvements</h4>

<p>The current PHP documentation has several blind spots, with many functions and methods not covered at all. We propose to update and modernize the English PHP documentation, review and remove user comments, integrate 3v4l.org for interactive examples, and simplify the maintenance process. This will make PHP more accessible to new developers and serve as a reliable reference for experienced ones.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-governance">The PHP Foundation Governance</h2>

<p>In 2023, we renamed the Administration group to the <strong>Governing Board</strong> to avoid confusions and better align with industry standards.</p>

<p><a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/#admins">The lineup</a> of the group has not changed and consists of veteran PHP community leaders, representatives of the founding companies, and other key stakeholders.</p>

<p>One notable change compared to the previous year is a full-time operations manager sponsored by JetBrains in addition to the financial contribution.</p>

<p>We aim to establish a level of involvement for other key stakeholders from the PHP world through the Advisory Board and other initiatives.</p>

<h2 id="the-advisory-board">The Advisory Board</h2>

<p>To keep major sponsors of PHP abreast of the latest happenings in the foundation and allow them to see the direct impact of their support, we announced the advisory board initiative <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2023/03/31/php-foundation-update-march-2023/#a-new-benefit-for-major-sponsors-%E2%80%93-advisory-board-membership">in March</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/">Governing Board</a> representatives from Automattic, JetBrains, Private Packagist, Symfony, Tideways, and Zend by Perforce, the <strong>Advisory Board includes members from</strong> Moodle, Shopware, Laravel, Ardennes-étape, Les-Tilleuls.coop / API Platform, Aternos GmbH, PrestaShop, CraftCMS.</p>

<p>Your company can <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/join/">become a member</a></strong> by contributing a minimum of $12,000 to The PHP Foundation as at least a Silver Sponsor.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-staff">The PHP Foundation Staff</h2>

<h3 id="renewing-contracts">Renewing contracts</h3>

<p>In 2023, we had a team of 6 developers. All of them demonstrated a high quality of work and dedication to the mission of the foundation. We were happy to renew the contracts for 2024 as well as extend the total number of hours for developers requesting it.</p>

<p>We have also adjusted the compensation rates for developers to better reflect the market, as the rates had not changed since 2021.</p>

<p>We aim to review the rates every year based on the available funding and priorities.</p>

<h3 id="team-extension">Team extension</h3>

<p>As was mentioned in the previous transparency report, we aimed to extend the team. It did not happen in 2023 because one of the prospective developers could not join the team for personal reasons, and had to step down from PHP core development entirely. Again, this is <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/#the_bus_factor">the Bus Factor at its worst</a>. However, we were able to extend the team starting with 2024.</p>

<p>We accepted applications for developer positions from September through October 2023. We received about 200 resumes, and we’ve chosen 4 developers with a proven track record of contributions to the PHP language and ecosystem.</p>

<p>We offered the new developers 6-month trial contracts so that the developers and the Governing Board can evaluate the results and then decide whether to continue the engagements.</p>

<h3 id="the-team-as-of-2024">The team as of 2024</h3>

<p>Starting from January, we now contract 10 developers to work on PHP:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arnaud Le Blanc</strong> <a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">@arnaud-lb</a></li>
<li><strong>David Carlier</strong> <a href="https://github.com/devnexen">@devnexen</a></li>
<li><strong>Derick Rethans</strong> <a href="https://github.com/derickr">@derickr</a></li>
<li><strong>Gina Peter Banyard</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Girgias">@Girgias</a></li>
<li><strong>Ilija Tovilo</strong> <a href="https://github.com/iluuu1994">@iluuu1994</a></li>
<li><strong>Jakub Zelenka</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bukka">@bukka</a></li>
<li><strong>James Titcumb</strong> <a href="https://github.com/asgrim">@asgrim</a></li>
<li><strong>Máté Kocsis</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kocsismate">@kocsismate</a></li>
<li><strong>Saki Takamachi</strong> <a href="https://github.com/SakiTakamachi">@SakiTakamachi</a></li>
<li><strong>Shivam Mathur</strong> <a href="https://github.com/shivammathur">@shivammathur</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="team-timeline">Team timeline</h3>

<p>We established the following timeline for team review.</p>

<ul>
<li>January 2024: Developers start work according to the new contracts.</li>
<li>May 2024: Evaluate new developers, contracts are extended, expanded, or terminated after the first 6 months.</li>
<li>September 2024: Open applications for new developers, evaluate performance of the current group of developers.</li>
<li>October 2024: Evaluate applications, work out updates to compensation, decide on a budget.</li>
<li>November 2024: Renew contracts with existing developers, potentially sign contracts with new developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>And in 2025 we start the cycle again.</p>

<h2 id="retrospective%3A-goals-of-2023">Retrospective: Goals of 2023</h2>

<p>In the previous report, we outlined a few organizational and technical goals. Let’s look back and evaluate the results.</p>

<h3 id="organization-goals">Organization goals</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Extend the foundation developers team. ✅</strong><br/>
We did not grow in 2023 strictly speaking, but the work done in 2023 helped to build the ground for two contracted developers to go full-time, as well as to hire 4 new developers.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Grow the community of the foundation. ✅</strong><br/>
The foundation’s Slack became a hub for the community and helped to move initiatives.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Improve communication and provide clear benefits for sponsors. ✅</strong> <br/>
We created a <a href="https://thephp.foundation/join/#membership-deck">deck with benefits for sponsors</a> and started the advisory board initiative. <br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Explore strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities. ✅ / ❌</strong><br/>
We received investment from the Sovereign Tech Fund and started collaboration with OSTIF.<br/>
We did not explore any marketing opportunities. And there is a room for many more strategic partnerships.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-goals">Technical goals</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ongoing maintenance and development of the PHP core.  ✅</strong> <br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Improve the quality of the ideas and RFCs coming from the foundation. ✅</strong><br/>
One of the examples here could be <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property Hooks RFC</a>. Although it has not been voted on yet, we have put amazing work into it and consulted many different parties to make it as good as possible.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Develop a high-level roadmap and vision for PHP changes sponsored by the foundation. ❌</strong><br/>
The roadmap and vision need further development and discussion. However, we conducted several pieces of research, both quantitative and qualitative. Some of these findings were shared at conferences where we participated, including PHPCon Poland, SymfonyCon, and Laracon EU. We plan to continue this work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="php-language-impact">PHP Language Impact</h2>

<p>On a daily basis, the PHP Foundation staff team contributes to the open-source repositories of the <a href="https://github.com/php">PHP GitHub organization</a>. The foundation team contributes in many forms: filing issues, reviewing pull requests, participating in discussions on mailing lists, triaging issues, submitting RFC proposals.</p>

<p>In this document, four categories of contributions are presented in more detail: commits to php-src, reviews of pull requests on php-src, submitted RFC documents, and documentation work.</p>

<h3 id="commits-to-php">Commits to PHP</h3>

<p>The following chart summarizes the number of commits made to the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a> repository in 2023.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2024">Goals for 2024</h2>

<p>Our foremost mission remains the same: <strong>maintain and develop the PHP language</strong>. We’d like PHP to be the best platform for users and for businesses creating web applications and APIs.</p>

<p>The main challenge for continuing the work of The PHP Foundation is to ensure sustainable sponsorship.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, the goal is to ensure that foundation developers work on valuable tasks.</p>

<h3 id="organization-goals">Organization goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Onboard new major sponsors.</li>
<li>Explore strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities.</li>
<li>Further develop the Advisory Board initiative.</li>
<li>Grow the foundation's community.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-goals">Technical goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ongoing maintenance and development of the PHP core.</li>
<li>Deliver the STF projects.</li>
<li>Improve the quality of the ideas and RFCs coming from the foundation.</li>
<li>Conduct research and surveys to define priorities.</li>
<li>Develop a high-level roadmap for PHP changes sponsored by the foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="budget-plan-for-2024">Budget plan for 2024</h2>

<p>In 2024, two of our part-time developers extended commitment to go full-time, and we contracted 4 new developers.</p>

<p>We have also adjusted the compensation rates for developers to better reflect the market, as the rates had not changed since 2021. As a result, our budget significantly increased.</p>

<p>With this plan, we estimate our annual spending cap at approximately <strong>$840,000</strong> for developer compensation.</p>

<p>Additionally, we anticipate receiving <strong>€205,000</strong> from the STF investment. These funds will be allocated to developer reimbursements and our partnership with OSTIF.org for an external security audit.</p>

<p>Our collaboration with the OpenCollective platform has been positive, and we plan to continue operating under the umbrella of the Open Source Collective in 2024. This means that sponsorships we receive are reduced by 10% for Open Source Collective fees and 1–5% for payment processing fees.</p>

<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>

<p>The PHP language is a living entity and, as such, requires continuous support to address developer issues, resolve security vulnerabilities, and has to evolve to meet the needs of the future.</p>

<p>Based on the strong second year of the foundation, we are excited to continue and multiply the efforts in the next years.</p>

<p>With your help, we continue the mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP language.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now in our third year, we're gearing up to grow our impact. This year, four more developers are joining the PHP Foundation to further advance PHP.</p>

<p>Since April 2022, the PHP Foundation has contracted six outstanding developers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arnaud Le Blanc <a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">@arnaud-lb</a></li>

<p>All of them started as part-time contributors, and since then have significantly grown their capacity and dedication to PHP core tasks. We consider it a big achievement that the team continues to collaborate effectively, accumulating more experience and knowledge, and expanding their PHP Core involvement.</p>

<h2 id="team-update-2024">Team Update 2024</h2>

<h2 id="team-growth">Team Growth</h2>

<p>In September, we initiated an open call for new developers to join the PHP Foundation by launching an <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2023/09/06/application-form-2023/">application form</a>.</p>

<p>We received a total of 207 applications. From this pool, we selected a shortlist of 12 qualified candidates. Following a comprehensive review and input from existing foundation members, we further refined our selection to 4 outstanding individuals. We will soon announce the new members.</p>

<p>The primary focus for the new developers will be on the maintenance and modernization of PHP’s infrastructure — a critical step towards ensuring PHP being a robust and forward-looking language.</p>

<p>The public work undertaken by our developers can be followed in our monthly <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/tag/roundup/">"PHP Core Roundup"</a> series, which highlights the ongoing progress and developments within PHP core.</p>

<h2 id="advisory-board">Advisory Board</h2>

<p>For our major sponsors, we offer exclusive insights through occasional digests that provide a deeper dive into discussions, debates, and early-stage developments. This not only keeps our sponsors abreast of the latest happenings but also allows them to see the direct impact of their support. This is one of the benefits of being an Advisory Board member.</p>

<p>We announced the advisory board initiative <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2023/03/31/php-foundation-update-march-2023/#a-new-benefit-for-major-sponsors-%E2%80%93-advisory-board-membership">in March</a>. Since then, 9 companies have joined the initiative with their representatives.</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/">Governing Board</a> that includes Automattic, JetBrains, Private Packagist, Symfony, Tideways, Zend by Perforce, and PHP fellows, we now welcome the Advisory Board members: Moodle, Shopware, Laravel, Ardennes-étape, Les-Tilleuls.coop / API Platform, Aternos GmbH, PrestaShop, CraftCMS.</p>

<p>There were several useful discussions within the group. Specifically, we’d like to highlight the one around <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property Hooks RFC</a>. The Advisory Board feedback helped to shape the proposal design significantly.</p>

<p>By the way, you can already try property hooks on <a href="https://3v4l.org/">3v4l.org</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/SjonHortensius">Sjon Hortensius</a>.

<h2 id="sovereign-tech-fund-invests-in-php">Sovereign Tech Fund invests in PHP</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a> is an organization that supports the development, improvement, and maintenance of open digital infrastructure in the public interest. Its goal to strengthen the open-source ecosystem sustainably, focusing on security, resilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the code. STF is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) and supported by the German Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation GmbH (SPRIND).</p>

<p>We have collaborated with STF to create work plans for these specific projects: PECL overhaul, Testing tool for FPM, Security Audit, and Documentation improvements.</p>

<p>We’ll share more details on each project early next year, and for now we are thrilled and grateful to the Sovereign Tech Fund for trusting us.</p>

<h2 id="security-audit-of-php-is-coming">Security audit of PHP is coming</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, STF is investing in PHP, and we are going to commission an audit of PHP's C code base. We expect security issues to be found. To mitigate possible bad perception, we aim to publish and fix the revealed security issues at the same time.</p>

<p>For this security audit, we are partnering with <a href="https://ostif.org/">The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc</a> (OSTIF), a corporate non-profit dedicated to securing critical open-source projects. They have a proven track record of audits for <a href="https://github.com/ostif-org/OSTIF/blob/main/Completed-Engagements.md">popular open-source projects</a> such as cURL, Git, Linux Kernel, OpenSSL, Node.js, and others.</p>

<h2 id="reports-schedule">Reports schedule</h2>

<p>Although we promised to prepare quarterly reports, that unfortunately did not happen to be feasible. So for 2023, we fall back to one yearly report. The 2023 transparency report will be published in December.</p>

<h2 id="meet-us-at-the-conferences">Meet us at the conferences</h2>

<p>You can meet our team at the following conferences in late 2023:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://php.bettercode.eu/">betterCode(PHP)</a> – Nov 27</strong></p>

<p>Jakub Zalenka will give a talk: "PHP 8.3: Changes and future plans". <br> 
Besides Jakub, there will be talks from Niels Dossche and Sebastian Bergmann.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://live.symfony.com/2023-brussels-con/">SymfonyCon Brussels</a> – Dec 7–8</strong></p>

<p>You’ll be able to meet and talk to our board members: Nils Adermann, Sebastian Bergmann, Nicolas Grekas, and Roman Pronskiy.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-to-our-sponsors">Thank you to our sponsors</h2>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/#sponsors">Sponsors section</a> on our <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">website</a>. It shows all major contributors sorted by donation amount.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.3">PHP 8.3</a> is here! Bringing a handful of new features, performance and functionality improvements, and a healthy amount of deprecations, PHP 8.3 was released today.</p>

<p>PHP 8.3 will continue to receive active support for two years, followed by one year of security updates. Similar to the PHP 8.2 upgrade, the PHP 8.3 upgrade will be smooth as backward compatiblity is maintained. While some functionality is deprecated, there are no syntax, API*, and remove functionality in this release.</p>

<h2 id="what%27s-in-php-8.3">What's in PHP 8.3</h2>

<p>Some of the major new features in PHP 8.3 include support for declaring a type for class constants, improvements to support deep-cloning of <code>readonly</code> properties, improvements to the new Random extension introduced in PHP 8.2, new <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-validate.php"><code>json_validate()</code></a>,<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-increment.php"><code>str_increment()</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-decrement.php"><code>str_decrement()</code></a>, functions, and a noticeable amount of improvements in DateTime, DOM, and Intl extensions.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.3">PHP 8.3 release page</a> for what's new and changed in PHP 8.3.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(*) Note that some of the PHP core extensions now declare types for built-in class constants. This is technically a BC break in case child classes declare the same constants without type declaration, which is only supported in PHP 8.3.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="upgrade-to-php-8.3">Upgrade to PHP 8.3</h2>

<p>PHP packages on software repositories such as Debian and Ubuntu repos maintained by <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ondrej">Ondřej Surý</a>, <a href="https://github.com/remicollet">Remi Collet</a> for Fedora/RHEL/EL already contain PHP 8.3 builds ready to install.</p>

<p>Windows builds for PHP 8.3 are available on <a href="https://windows.php.net/download/">windows.php.net</a></p>

<p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php">Docker images</a> with PHP 8.3 will also be available on Docker hub in the coming days.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-release-in-numbers">PHP 8.3 Release in Numbers</h2>

<p>The PHP 8.3 release contains <strong>over 1200 code commits</strong> from <strong>114 awesome contributors</strong> to the <code>php-src</code> repository, and several more contributions to the documentation and its translations.</p>

<p>Contributions from the <strong>PHP Foundation members</strong> consist of over <strong>280 commits</strong>.</p>

<p>During the period from the PHP 8.2 release date and today, the <strong>PHP Internals mailing list has received over 2800 emails</strong>.</p>

<p>PHP RFCs, where major changes to PHP are proposed, discussed, and voted on, PHP 8.3 received <strong>23 RFCs that went to a vote</strong>, and <strong>18 RFCs passed</strong>. This includes a number includes "catch-all" RFCs such as Deprecations for PHP 8.3, where multiple changes were voted at the same time. Out of the 23 RFCs with votes, <strong>13 RFCs</strong> were either proposed or implemented by the <strong>PHP Foundation</strong> members.</p>

<p>The PHP documentation and php.net web site contributors have also made several impactful contributions to document the new features in PHP 8.3, prepare release pages, and more.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%92%9C-thank-you-%F0%9F%92%9C">💜 Thank you 💜</h2>

<p>On behalf of the PHP Foundation, we take this post to thank everyone from this milestone in PHP. Your contributions to the PHP Foundation, code and documentation contributions, and several other ways of involvement and contributions help shape PHP to continue to be an exciting, feature-rich, and versatile programming language.</p>

<p>Thank you 💜</p>

<h2 id="php-8.4-outlook">PHP 8.4 Outlook</h2>

<p>PHP 8.4, scheduled for the end of 2024 is already taking shape. Even at the moment PHP 8.3 is released, there are three active RFC votes, and some major changes such as JIT-IR, a brand-new HTML 5 parser in the DOM extension based on <a href="https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor">Lexbor</a>, and Bcrypt default cost increasing already been implemented for PHP 8.4</p>

<p>We look forward to bringing you updates on our <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/tag/roundup/">PHP Core Roundup series</a> and our newsletter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The PHP Foundation is a collective of PHP contributors, veterans, and companies that collaborate to ensure the long-term sustainability of the PHP programming language. The foundation currently supports six contributors focused on PHP's maintenance, debt reduction, and feature development. These contributors work closely with others on coding, documentation, and discussions.</p>
  
  <p>Started over a year ago, the PHP Core Roundup series offers a summary of the latest developments, discussions, and news about PHP Core, contributed by both PHP Foundation members and other participants. This post is the thirteenth in the PHP Core Roundup series.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-ga-to-be-released-this-month%21">PHP 8.3 GA to be released this month!</h2>

<p>PHP 8.3.0 GA is scheduled to be released on November 23rd. PHP 8.3.0 RC5 is already released, and RC6 (the last one) is scheduled for November, 9.</p>

<p>PHP 8.3.0 RC versions are available in <a href="https://rpms.remirepo.net/">Remi’s</a> repos for Fedora/RHEL, <a href="https://deb.sury.org/#php-packages">Ondrej's</a> repos for Debian/Ubuntu LTS, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags?page=1&amp;name=8.3">Docker images</a> on Docker Hub, and compiled Windows binaries on <a href="https://windows.php.net/">windows.php.net</a>.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.0-will-reach-eol">PHP 8.0 will reach EOL</h2>

<p>PHP 8.0 will reach its End of Life (EOL) and will no longer receive security updates after November 26, 2023. You can always check the release and support schedule at <a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php">php.net/supported-versions.php</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2023/roundup-18/supported_versions_php.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="rfc-updates">RFC Updates</h2>

<p>Following are the RFCs and major pull-requests discussed, voted, and implemented since our last update.</p>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-straw-poll---how-to-name-the-process-resource-after-it-is-converted-to-an-object-by-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C">In Voting: Straw poll - How to name the Process resource after it is converted to an object by Máté Kocsis 💜</h3>

<p>As part of PHP's efforts in gradually phrasing out <code>resource</code> objects (<a href="https://github.com/php/php-tasks/issues/6">php-tasks#6</a>, <a href="https://php.watch/articles/resource-object">article on PHP.Watch</a>), this RFC polls the proposed names for the resource object class name that replaces <code>Process</code> resources. This ranked-choice poll (following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote#Example">STV</a>) intends to pick a name from <code>\Process</code>, <code>\ProcessHandle</code>, and <code>\OS\Process</code>.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-increasing-the-default-bcrypt-cost-by-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023">Increasing the default BCrypt cost</a> by Tim Düsterhus</h3>

<p>RFC was approved unanimously, but in the second vote, where a new cost value had to be determined, opinions were divided.</p>

<p>The cost will be increased to 12 in PHP 8.4.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-xml_option_parse_huge-by-niels-dossche">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/xml_option_parse_huge">XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>A new option will be added to the event-driven (SAX) <code>XmlParser</code> that would allow it to parse large documents.</p>

<h3 id="accepted%3A-dom-html5-parsing-and-serialization-by-niels-dossche">Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/domdocument_html5_parser">DOM HTML5 parsing and serialization</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 will get new classes: <code>DOM\HTMLDocument</code> and <code>DOM\XMLDocument</code> to the <code>dom</code> extension. Existing <code>dom</code> classes in the global namespace get an alias in the new <code>DOM</code> namespace.</p>

<p>The <code>HTMLDocument</code> class will add support for HTML5 document parsing and serializing. The <code>XMLDocument</code> class serves as a modern alternative to <code>\DOMDocument</code>, which is retained for compatibility. These new classes also provide a more misuse-resistant API for loading documents.</p>

<h3 id="accepted%3A-a-new-jit-implementation-based-on-ir-framework-by-dmitry-stogov">Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit-ir">A new JIT implementation based on IR Framework</a> by Dmitry Stogov</h3>

<p>RFC proposed a new JIT implementation based on a separately developed <a href="https://github.com/dstogov/ir">IR Framework</a>. The main advantage of the new approach is that PHP source code will be freed from the low-level details of JIT compilation. The downside is a longer JIT-compilation time.</p>

<p>The proposal was accepted, so Dmitry Stogov <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/12079">merged</a> the new JIT into the <code>master</code> which means it will be available in PHP 8.4.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-rfc1867-for-non-post-http-verbs-by-ilija-tovilo-%F0%9F%92%9C">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/rfc1867-non-post">RFC1867 for non-POST HTTP verbs</a> by Ilija Tovilo 💜</h3>

<p>Now PHP supports the parsing of <code>multipart/form-data</code> content type natively, but only for POST requests. If POST request has the <code>multipart/form-data</code> content type, the request body is immediately consumed before starting the PHP script and populated into the <code>$_POST</code> and <code>$_FILES</code> superglobals.</p>

<p>RFC proposes to add a new function <code>request_parse_body()</code> to expose the existing functionality to userland so that it may be used for other HTTP verbs.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-rounding-integers-as-int-by-marc-bennewitz">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/integer-rounding">Rounding Integers as int</a> by Marc Bennewitz</h3>

<p>Currently <code>round()</code>, <code>ceil()</code> and <code>floor()</code> functions return float numbers, but when using integers above <code>2^53</code> you get unexpected results due to loss of precision.</p>

<p>RFC proposes to perform rounding for a given integer and returning the resulting integer if possible.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-unbundle-ext%2Fimap%2C-ext%2Fpspell%2C-ext%2Foci8%2C-and-ext%2Fpdo_oci-by-derick-rethans-%F0%9F%92%9C">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unbundle_imap_pspell_oci8">Unbundle ext/imap, ext/pspell, ext/oci8, and ext/PDO_OCI</a> by Derick Rethans 💜</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to unbundle these extensions: remove them from the PHP source distribution, and move them to PECL.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-multibyte-for-trim-function-mb_trim%2C-mb_ltrim-and-mb_rtrim-by-yuya-hamada">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mb_trim">Multibyte for trim function mb_trim, mb_ltrim and mb_rtrim</a> by Yuya Hamada</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add multibyte support for trim functions.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-change-the-edge-case-of-round-by-saki-takamachi">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/change_the_edge_case_of_round">Change the edge case of round()</a> by Saki Takamachi</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to change the <code>round()</code> behavior, and stop expecting decimal behavior to float point and start expecting floating point to behave as floating point.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>While PHP 8.3 is just around the corner, the documentation available on <a href="https://php.net">php.net</a>, requires updating.</p>

<p>Gina P. Banyard 💜 is tracking the progress for PHP 8.3 related changes in <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues/2796">php/doc-en#2796</a>, and also triaged issues in the docs and marked several of them as "<a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">good first time</a>", which are ideal easy picks if you would like to start contributing to PHP docs. You can find the full list on <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="php-security-audit-organized-by-the-php-foundation-%F0%9F%92%9C">PHP Security Audit organized by The PHP Foundation 💜</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation intends to conduct a security audit of the PHP source code. Derick Rethans 💜 has asked the PHP Internals mailing list for input on which sections of the PHP source code should be prioritized in this audit. Feel free to join the <a href="https://externals.io/message/121135">conversation</a> if you have suggestions.</p>

<h2 id="releases">Releases</h2>

<p>The PHP development team released two new versions in September 2023:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-09-28-1">PHP 8.2.11</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-09-28-3">PHP 8.1.24</a></strong></p>

<p>These releases include several bug fixes and improvements, notably in areas such as Core, DOM, Iconv, Intl, MySQLnd, ODBC, SimpleXML, SPL, and SQLite3.</p>

<h2 id="recent-rfcs-and-mailing-list-discussions">Recent RFCs and Mailing List Discussions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">issue tracker</a>, changes are discussed in <a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php">mailing lists</a>, minor code changes are proposed as <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">pull requests</a>, and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">PHP RFCs</a>. <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/">Documentation</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">php.net website</a> changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-release-page">PHP 8.3 Release Page</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php/pull/807">pull-request</a> for the upcoming PHP 8.3 release page on php.net is in progress, and you can help with that!</p>

<p>This is a continuation of <a href="https://externals.io/message/112026">a good tradition</a> started by Roman Pronskiy, Alexander Makarov, and the JetBrains design team.</p>

<p>Check out how these pages looked like for <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php">PHP 8.0</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.1/en.php">PHP 8.1</a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.2/en.php">PHP 8.2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="early-developments-for-php-8.4">Early-developments for PHP 8.4</h2>

<p>Although PHP 8.3 is still being ironed out, there are some discussions and even an RFC currently being voted for proposed changes in PHP 8.4 (scheduled for the end of 2024).</p>

<h3 id="declined%3A-support-optional-suffix-parameter-in-tempnam-by-athos-ribeiro">Declined: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tempnam-suffix-v2">Support optional suffix parameter in tempnam</a> by Athos Ribeiro</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add a new optional suffix parameter to the <code>tempnam()</code> function.</p>

<p>A suffix could provide even more semantic value or context for a user inspecting the generated files, and, in specific situations, could even provide more context for software processing such files. Right now, users can only add a prefix.</p>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-increasing-the-default-bcrypt-cost-by-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus">In Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023">Increasing the default BCrypt cost</a> by Tim Düsterhus</h3>

<p>The RFC proposes increasing the default BCrypt cost. This is to enhance adaptive security in relation to increased processing power and thus increased possible cracking speed.</p>

<p>The last time the value was updated 11 years ago. Therefore, Tim suggests updating the default cost from 10 to either 11 (double the time) or 12 (quadruple the time). The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023">RFC</a> and the relevant <a href="https://externals.io/message/121004">mailing list thread</a> mention several benchmarks showing the execution time for various cost levels on different CPUs.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-dom-html5-parsing-and-serialization-by-niels-dossche">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/domdocument_html5_parser">DOM HTML5 parsing and serialization</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add two new classes: <code>DOM\HTMLDocument</code> and <code>DOM\XMLDocument</code> to the dom extension. Furthermore, existing dom classes in the global namespace get an alias in the new DOM namespace. The <code>HTMLDocument</code> class will add support for HTML5 document parsing and serializing. The <code>XMLDocument</code> class serves as a modern alternative to <code>\DOMDocument</code>, which is retained for compatibility. These new classes also provide a more misuse-resistant API for loading documents.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-xml_option_parse_huge-by-niels-dossche">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/xml_option_parse_huge">XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add a new option to the event-driven (SAX) <code>XmlParser</code> that would allow it to parse large documents.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-add-4-new-rounding-modes-to-round-function-by-jorg-sowa">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/new_rounding_modes_to_round_function">Add 4 new rounding modes to round() function</a> by Jorg Sowa</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add four new modes to the <code>round()</code> function: <code>PHP_ROUND_CEILING</code>, <code>PHP_ROUND_FLOOR</code>, <code>PHP_ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO</code>, <code>PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO</code>.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-a-new-jit-implementation-based-on-ir-framework-by-dmitry-stogov">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit-ir">A new JIT implementation based on IR Framework</a> by Dmitry Stogov</h3>

<p>RFC proposes a new JIT implementation that is based on a separately developed <a href="https://github.com/dstogov/ir">IR Framework</a>. The main advantage of the new approach is that PHP source code will be freed from the low-level details of JIT compilation. The downside is a longer JIT-compilation time.</p>

<p>Dmitry <a href="https://externals.io/message/121038">emailed</a> PHP Internals mailing list, which led to a lengthy discussion on the merits of the new JIT implementation.</p>

<h3 id="draft%3A-deprecations-for-php-8.4-rfc-by-niels-dossche">Draft: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_4">Deprecations for PHP 8.4 RFC</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>RFC is currently in draft, which stands to track ideas on deprecating certain features. So far those are related to the <code>DOMAttr::$schemaTypeInfo</code>, <code>DOMElement::$schemaTypeInfo</code> properties, <code>DOMImplementation::getFeature()</code>, <code>mysqli_ping()</code>, <code>mysqli::ping()</code> functions, and <code>DOM_PHP_ERR</code> constant.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>While PHP 8.3 has moved to the RC cycle, the documentation available on <a href="https://php.net">php.net</a>, requires updating. An initial version of the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration83.php">PHP 8.3 migration guide</a> has been published by Yoshinari Takaoka.</p>

<p>Gina P. Banyard 💜 is tracking the progress for PHP 8.3 related changes in <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues/2796">php/doc-en#2796</a>, and also triaged issues in the docs and marked several of them as "good first time", which are ideal easy picks if you would like to start contributing to PHP docs. You can find the full list on <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Working on an open-source project which is used by millions of developers and which is trusted by hundreds of thousands of businesses around the world. Getting paid for this work and not having a burnout. Sounds like a dream, doesn't it? But this is exactly the opportunity that the PHP Foundation provides to those who would like to develop and maintain the PHP language.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation is a non-profit organization, started in 2021 by Acquia, Automattic, Craft CMS, JetBrains, Laravel, PrestaShop, Private Packagist, Symfony, Tideways, and Zend by Perforce with a mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP language.</p>

<p>Since April 2022, the foundation pays <a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/#core_developers">six developers</a> to work on the language. See what the foundation accomplished in 2022 in the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/11/22/transparency-and-impact-report-2022/">Impact and transparency report</a>.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-opening-applications-for-new-positions-at%26nbsp%3Bthe%26nbsp%3Bphp%26nbsp%3Bfoundation">We are opening applications for new positions at&nbsp;the&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;Foundation</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation is almost two years old, and we are gradually introducing structure into our activities and organizing processes. We’re opening a new round of applications for developer positions. We plan to open applications every September from now on, so if you are unable to apply now, you will have another chance next year. We intend to decide on who we will hire by the end of October. If selected, you would start your work January 1st, 2024.</p>

<p>The application form will be <strong>open until September 30, 2023</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="https://forms.gle/Ji7Vvj1y2bMf9pUz7" class="inline-block py-2 no-underline px-6 !text-white bg-[#7f52ff] rounded-3xl hover:bg-[rgba(127,82,255,.8)]">Apply</a>
</p>

<div class="alert">
    <span class="inline-block font-bold">Note: This is not a job for PHP developers or aspiring PHP developers.</span><br> 
The development of PHP is done in the С programming language, and requires proficiency in system programming.
</div>

<h2 id="what-are-the-requirements%3F">What are the requirements?</h2>

<p>As before, we require previous experience in PHP core development. Ideally you should have all, but at least some of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pull-requests / commits to <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/">php/php-src</a></li>
<li>Experience in writing PHP extensions</li>
<li>Participation in PHP mailing lists</li>
<li>Contributions to other open-source projects</li>
</ul>

<p>This time, however, we have a clearer idea of the tasks that can be engaged in and so the pool of considered candidates will be wider.</p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-going-to-work-on%3F">What am I going to work on?</h2>

<p>Strategic areas we’d like you to work on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Web APIs (json, PDO, streams, etc.)</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list, and if you would like to do something else, make sure to mention it in the form. The main criteria is a pragmatic approach. In this sense, we adhere to the position that Rasmus&nbsp;Lerdorf, the author of PHP, voiced back in 2014:</p>

<pre><code class="Text">And rather than piling on language features with the main justification
being that other languages have them, I would love to see more focus on
practical solutions to real problems. The password_hash() addition in
5.5 is a good example of addressing a real Web problem.
…
I know these are much harder and less sexy than adding a couple
of tokens to the yacc grammar, but when we start looking at a new major
release this is what I hear from people who are running PHP in
production environments are looking for. Language features are nice, if
they are well thought out, but significant infrastructure improvements
are nicer.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="what-does-working-for-the-php-foundation-look-like%3F">What does working for the PHP foundation look like?</h2>

<p>Working for the PHP Foundation offers a lot of freedom, but it also requires discipline. Your work will roughly consist of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>40% Triaging issues and fixing bugs</li>
<li>30% Working on strategic areas</li>
<li>20% Code reviews</li>
<li>10% Preparing RFCs and developing new language features</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, developing new RFCs is a fairly small part of the job. Most of the work is a typical maintenance of an open source project.</p>

<p>We are a fully distributed team. You can work from any place* and at any time. All communication is asynchronous via GitHub, Slack, and Email. We meet for synchronous calls 1-2 times a month.</p>

<p><em><strong>&#42;</strong> We do not consider applications from persons residing in sanctioned territories.</em></p>

<p>Your work should be in line with the foundation’s mission statement, and we expect you to follow <a href="https://thephp.foundation/code-of-conduct/">the code of conduct</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>PHP Foundation Mission Statement</strong></p>
  
  <p>The PHP Foundation is a collective of people and organizations relying on the PHP language. Its mission is to ensure the long-term prosperity of the PHP language.

<h2 id="php-8.3-branching-out">PHP 8.3 Branching Out</h2>

<p>PHP 8.3 has reached its <a href="/blog/2023/08/01/php-core-roundup-15/#php-8.3-feature-freeze">feature-freeze</a>, and <a href="/blog/2023/05/02/php-core-roundup-12/#php-8.3-release-managers-elected">release managers</a> branched out the PHP-8.3 branch on August 31.</p>

<p>Now that PHP 8.3 is in a separate branch, the <code>master</code> branch will be the development source for PHP 8.4. Bug fixes and other improvements will be cherry-picked for PHP 8.3 (and older branches) as appropriate, but new features that are made to the master branch will not be merged to the PHP 8.3 branch.</p>

<p>Tools that build PHP based on the Git branches will also see a new branch, and the builds from the <code>master</code> branch will be named “PHP 8.4” for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="releases">Releases</h2>

<p>The PHP development team released five new versions in August 2023:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-31-2">PHP 8.2.10</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-31-3">PHP 8.1.23</a></strong></p>

<p>These releases include several bug fixes and improvements, notably in areas such as CLI, Date, Core, DOM, FFI, Hash, MySQLnd, Opcache, PCNTL, SPL, and Standard.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-16-1">PHP 8.2.9</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-03-1">PHP 8.1.22</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-04-1">PHP 8.0.30</a></strong></p>

<p>All three include security fixes: <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-3qrf-m4j2-pcrr">GHSA-3qrf-m4j2-pcrr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-jqcx-ccgc-xwhv">GHSA-jqcx-ccgc-xwhv</a>.</p>

<p>PHP 8.2.9 and PHP 8.1.22 additionally include several bug fixes and improvements, notably in areas such as Build, CLI, Core, Curl, Date, DOM, Fileinfo, FTP, GD, Intl, MBString, Opcache, PCNTL, PDO, PDO SQLite, Phar, PHPDBG, Session, Standard, Streams, SQLite3, and XMLReader.</p>

<h2 id="recent-rfcs-and-mailing-list-discussions">Recent RFCs and Mailing List Discussions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">issue tracker</a>, changes are discussed in <a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php">mailing lists</a>, minor code changes are proposed as <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">pull requests</a>, and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">PHP RFCs</a>. <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/">Documentation</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">php.net website</a> changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="rfc-updates">RFC Updates</h2>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-support-optional-suffix-parameter-in-tempnam-by-athos-ribeiro">In Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tempnam-suffix-v2">Support optional suffix parameter in tempnam</a> by Athos Ribeiro</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add a new optional suffix parameter to the <code>tempnam()</code> function.</p>

<p>A suffix could provide even more semantic value or context for a user inspecting the generated files, and, in specific situations, could even provide more context for software processing such files. Right now, users can only add a prefix.</p>

<h3 id="merging-postponed%3A-pdo-driver-specific-sub-classes-by-danack">Merging postponed: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pdo_driver_specific_subclasses">PDO driver specific sub-classes</a> by Danack</h3>

<p>This RFC proposed to introduce driver-specific <code>\PDO</code> sub-classes so applications can granular declare the specific PDO drivers they support.</p>

<p>This RFC vote was completed and accepted unanimously, but due to the implementation complexity, the changes for this RFC were not finalized before the PHP 8.3.0RC1 release. Because PHP 8.3 is beyond its feature-freeze and now that the first release candidate is released, the consensus seems to be that this RFC will not be implemented in PHP 8.3 but on the next PHP version.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>While PHP 8.3 has moved to the RC cycle, the documentation available on <a href="https://php.net">php.net</a>, requires updating.</p>

<p>Gina P. Banyard 💜 has triaged issues in the docs and marked several of them as "good first time", which are ideal easy picks if you would like to start contributing to PHP docs. You can find the full list on <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To make it easier to view the results of changes locally, Anna Filina has prepared a Docker Compose set-up. <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/pull/2638">Check it out</a>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="merged-prs-and-commits">Merged PRs and Commits</h2>

<p>Following are some changes that did not go through an RFC process because they are either planned, bug fixes, or progressive enhancements.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-feature-freeze">PHP 8.3 Feature-Freeze</h2>

<p>On July 18, PHP 8.3 branch reached its feature-freeze. As the name suggests, the list of features we plan to ship with PHP 8.3 is now frozen. Contributors who wish to make substantial changes to PHP should now target the next PHP version, PHP 8.4.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, the PHP Foundation members, the PHP development team, and contributors will be making improvements to get PHP 8.3 ready for production release.</p>

<p>Release managers elected for PHP 8.3, Pierrick Charron, Jakub Zelenka, and Eric Mann will have the final say in case a major change must be made to the PHP 8.3.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-beta-release">PHP 8.3 Beta Release</h2>

<p>The second beta release of PHP 8.3 was released this week. Now would be an ideal time to test your PHP applications on PHP 8.3.</p>

<p>Compiled Windows binaries are available at <a href="https://windows.php.net/qa/">windows.php.net/qa</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags?page=1&amp;name=8.3.0">Docker images</a> are available at Docker Hub, and source code at <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src repository on GitHub</a> to compile yourself. On Homebrew, <code>PHP 8.3.0-dev</code> packages are available from <code><a href="https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php">shivammathur/php</a></code> tap.</p>

<p>CI/CD platforms that use Docker images can use the PHP 8.2 docker images available with various base images. GitHub Actions can also make use of <code><a href="https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php">shivammathur/setup-php</a></code> action, which supports PHP 8.3 builds.</p>

<h2 id="php-bug-fix-releases">PHP Bug Fix Releases</h2>

<p>The PHP development team released two new versions in July 2023:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-07-06-2">PHP 8.2.8</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-07-06-3">PHP 8.1.21</a></strong></p>

<p>These releases include bug fixes across various components such as CLI, Core, Curl, DOM, Opcache, OpenSSL, PGSQL, Phar, SPL, and Standard.</p>

<h2 id="recent-rfcs-and-mailing-list-discussions">Recent RFCs and Mailing List Discussions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">issue tracker</a>, changes are discussed in <a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php">mailing lists</a>, minor code changes are proposed as <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">pull requests</a>, and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">PHP RFCs</a>. <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/">Documentation</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">php.net website</a> changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="rfc-updates">RFC Updates</h2>

<h3 id="accepted%3A-pdo-driver-specific-sub-classes-by-danack">Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pdo_driver_specific_subclasses">PDO driver specific sub-classes</a> by Danack</h3>

<p>PHP's PDO extension supports connecting to multiple database software by using different database drivers available. Some of these drivers include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Although most of these database support a common set of features, all of these databases have evolved to provide additional features that PDO <em>sometimes</em> can support, but there is no easy way for a library to check for these capabilities without having to inspect the driver and their versions.</p>

<p>This RFC proposes to create driver-specific sub classes of <code>\PDO</code>, so libraries and applications can easily indicate the database driver they expect, and make use of IDE autocompletion and proper error handling.</p>

<p>The vote was unanimously accepted, and is pending implementation.</p>

<h3 id="accepted%3A-deprecate-functions-with-overloaded-signatures-by-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C">Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_functions_with_overloaded_signatures">Deprecate Functions with Overloaded Signatures</a> by Máté Kocsis 💜</h3>

<p>This RFC proposes to deprecate a number of functions that have overloaded signatures, meaning they behave differently based on the number or type of arguments passed to them. The goal is to make PHP's function signatures more consistent and predictable.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-deprecations-for-php-8.3-by-gina-peter-banyard-%F0%9F%92%9C%2C-christoph-m.-becker%2C-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C%2C-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus%2C-go-kudo%2C-andreas-heigl">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_3">Deprecations for PHP 8.3</a> by Gina Peter Banyard 💜, Christoph M. Becker, Máté Kocsis 💜, Tim Düsterhus, Go Kudo, Andreas Heigl</h3>

<p>The aim is to clean up some of the older, less consistent parts of PHP to make the language more reliable and predictable. The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passing negative <code>$widths</code> to <code>mb_strimwidth()</code></li>
<li>The <code>NumberFormatter::TYPE_CURRENCY</code> constant</li>
<li><code>MT_RAND_PHP</code></li>
<li>Calling <code>ldap_connect</code> with 2 parameters</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-marking-overridden-methods-by-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_overriden_methods">Marking Overridden Methods</a> by Tim Düsterhus</h3>

<p>PHP 8.3 will have a new attribute <code>#[\Override]</code>. If this attribute is added to a method, the engine will validate that a method with the same name exists in a parent class or any of the implemented interfaces. If no such method exists, a compile time error will be emitted.</p>

<p>The similar concepts exist in Java, TypeScript, C++, C#, Swift, Kotlin, and other languages.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-path-to-saner-increment%2Fdecrement-operators-by-gina-peter-banyard--%F0%9F%92%9C">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/saner-inc-dec-operators">Path to Saner Increment/Decrement operators</a> by Gina Peter Banyard  💜</h3>

<p>This RFC proposed several improvements to normalize the behavior of <code>$v++</code> and <code>$v--</code> to be the same as <code>$v += 1</code> and <code>$v -= 1</code>, which PHP is currently inconsistent on.</p>

<p>It deprecates certain patterns, and introduces two new functions named <code>str_increment</code> and <code>str_decrement</code> to provide the deprecated behavior in a conscious way.</p>
