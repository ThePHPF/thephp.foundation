Now in our third year, we're gearing up to grow our impact. This year, four more developers are joining the PHP Foundation to further advance PHP.

Since April 2022, the PHP Foundation has contracted six outstanding developers:

* Arnaud Le Blanc [@arnaud-lb](https://github.com/arnaud-lb)
* Derick Rethans [@derickr](https://github.com/derickr)
* Gina Peter Banyard [@Girgias](https://github.com/Girgias)
* Ilija Tovilo [@iluuu1994](https://github.com/iluuu1994)
* Jakub Zelenka [@bukka](https://github.com/bukka)
* M√°t√© Kocsis [@kocsismate](https://github.com/kocsismate)

All of them started as part-time contributors, and since then have significantly grown their capacity and dedication to PHP core tasks. We consider it a big achievement that the team continues to collaborate effectively, accumulating more experience and knowledge, and expanding their PHP Core involvement.

## Team Update 2024

We are happy to announce a team expansion. Four talented developers are joining as part-time team members of the foundation.

* David Carlier [@devnexen](https://github.com/devnexen)
* James Titcumb [@asgrim](https://github.com/asgrim)
* Saki Takamachi [@SakiTakamachi](https://github.com/SakiTakamachi)
* Shivam Mathur [@shivammathur](https://github.com/shivammathur)

Please give them a warm welcome! We are looking forward to the great things we will accomplish together.

Happy New Year! üéâüêòüíú
