Welcome back to [PHP Core Roundup](/blog/tag/roundup/) series! This is post #17, where we highlight and celebrate the improvements made to PHP during the month past by the PHP development team, members of the PHP Foundation, and more.

> The PHP Foundation is a collective of PHP contributors, veterans, and companies that collaborate to ensure the long-term sustainability of the PHP programming language. The foundation currently supports six contributors focused on PHP's maintenance, debt reduction, and feature development. These contributors work closely with others on coding, documentation, and discussions.

> Started over a year ago, the PHP Core Roundup series offers a summary of the latest developments, discussions, and news about PHP Core, contributed by both PHP Foundation members and other participants. This post is the thirteenth in the PHP Core Roundup series.

## PHP Security Audit organized by The PHP Foundation 💜

The PHP Foundation intends to conduct a security audit of the PHP source code. Derick Rethans 💜 has asked the PHP Internals mailing list for input on which sections of the PHP source code should be prioritized in this audit. Feel free to join the [conversation](https://externals.io/message/121135) if you have suggestions.

## Releases

The PHP development team released two new versions in September 2023:

**[PHP 8.2.11](https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-09-28-1)** and **[PHP 8.1.24](https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-09-28-3)**

These releases include several bug fixes and improvements, notably in areas such as Core, DOM, Iconv, Intl, MySQLnd, ODBC, SimpleXML, SPL, and SQLite3.

## Recent RFCs and Mailing List Discussions


> Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP [issue tracker](https://github.com/php/php-src/issues), changes are discussed in [mailing lists](https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php), minor code changes are proposed as [pull requests](https://github.com/php/php-src/issues), and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as [PHP RFCs](https://wiki.php.net/rfc). [Documentation](https://github.com/php/doc-en/) and the [php.net website](https://github.com/php/web-php) changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.

<br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.

## PHP 8.3 Release Page

A [pull-request](https://github.com/php/web-php/pull/807) for the upcoming PHP 8.3 release page on php.net is in progress, and you can help with that!

This is a continuation of [a good tradition](https://externals.io/message/112026) started by Roman Pronskiy, Alexander Makarov, and the JetBrains design team.

Check out how these pages looked like for [PHP 8.0](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php), [PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/releases/8.1/en.php), and [PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/releases/8.2/en.php).

## Early-developments for PHP 8.4

Although PHP 8.3 is still being ironed out, there are some discussions and even an RFC currently being voted for proposed changes in PHP 8.4 (scheduled for the end of 2024).

### Declined: [Support optional suffix parameter in tempnam](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tempnam-suffix-v2) by Athos Ribeiro

RFC proposes to add a new optional suffix parameter to the `tempnam()` function.

A suffix could provide even more semantic value or context for a user inspecting the generated files, and, in specific situations, could even provide more context for software processing such files. Right now, users can only add a prefix.

### In Voting: [Increasing the default BCrypt cost](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023) by Tim Düsterhus

The RFC proposes increasing the default BCrypt cost. This is to enhance adaptive security in relation to increased processing power and thus increased possible cracking speed. 

The last time the value was updated 11 years ago. Therefore, Tim suggests updating the default cost from 10 to either 11 (double the time) or 12 (quadruple the time). The [RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023) and the relevant [mailing list thread](https://externals.io/message/121004) mention several benchmarks showing the execution time for various cost levels on different CPUs.

### Under Discussion: [DOM HTML5 parsing and serialization](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/domdocument_html5_parser) by Niels Dossche

RFC proposes to add two new classes: `DOM\HTMLDocument` and `DOM\XMLDocument` to the dom extension. Furthermore, existing dom classes in the global namespace get an alias in the new DOM namespace. The `HTMLDocument` class will add support for HTML5 document parsing and serializing. The `XMLDocument` class serves as a modern alternative to `\DOMDocument`, which is retained for compatibility. These new classes also provide a more misuse-resistant API for loading documents.

### Under Discussion: [XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/xml_option_parse_huge) by Niels Dossche

RFC proposes to add a new option to the event-driven (SAX) `XmlParser` that would allow it to parse large documents.

### Under Discussion: [Add 4 new rounding modes to round() function](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/new_rounding_modes_to_round_function) by Jorg Sowa

RFC proposes to add four new modes to the `round()` function: `PHP_ROUND_CEILING`, `PHP_ROUND_FLOOR`, `PHP_ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO`, `PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO`.

### Under Discussion: [A new JIT implementation based on IR Framework](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit-ir) by Dmitry Stogov

RFC proposes a new JIT implementation that is based on a separately developed [IR Framework](https://github.com/dstogov/ir). The main advantage of the new approach is that PHP source code will be freed from the low-level details of JIT compilation. The downside is a longer JIT-compilation time.

Dmitry [emailed](https://externals.io/message/121038) PHP Internals mailing list, which led to a lengthy discussion on the merits of the new JIT implementation.

### Draft: [Deprecations for PHP 8.4 RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_4) by Niels Dossche

RFC is currently in draft, which stands to track ideas on deprecating certain features. So far those are related to the `DOMAttr::$schemaTypeInfo`, `DOMElement::$schemaTypeInfo` properties, `DOMImplementation::getFeature()`, `mysqli_ping()`, `mysqli::ping()` functions, and `DOM_PHP_ERR` constant.

## Documentation

While PHP 8.3 has moved to the RC cycle, the documentation available on [php.net](https://php.net), requires updating. An initial version of the [PHP 8.3 migration guide](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration83.php) has been published by Yoshinari Takaoka.

George P. Banyard 💜 is tracking the progress for PHP 8.3 related changes in [php/doc-en#2796](https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues/2796), and also triaged issues in the docs and marked several of them as "good first time", which are ideal easy picks if you would like to start contributing to PHP docs. You can find the full list on [GitHub](https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
