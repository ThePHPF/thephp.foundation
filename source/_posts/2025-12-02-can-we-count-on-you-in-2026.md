As 2025 comes to a close, we at The PHP Foundation want to take a moment to thank everyone who has supported us this year. We firmly believe that our work on the PHP language continues to have a massive impact, and we couldn’t have done it without the amazing PHP community and our generous sponsors.

## **Our Achievements This Year**

Now in our fourth year, The PHP Foundation has achieved several milestones that have further strengthened the PHP ecosystem:

* [Release of PHP 8.5](https://www.php.net/releases/8.5/en.php)
* [PIE 1.0 Release](https://github.com/php/pie)
* [Supporting FrankenPHP](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/05/15/frankenphp/)
* [PHP MCP SDK together with Anthropic and Symfony](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/09/05/php-mcp-sdk/)
* 2nd [Sovereign Tech Agency](https://www.sovereign.tech/) Investment for the [Stream Layer Rework](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/10/30/php-streams-evolution/)

If you are yet to decide on sponsoring the foundation, [here](https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/) you can find information on how to join us and why it matters or reach out directly to [contact@thephp.foundation](mailto:contact@thephp.foundation).

## Outlook into 2026

Big changes are ahead for 2026, when our founding and long-term executive director [Roman Pronskiy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pronskiy/) (JetBrains) will step down and the foundation will hire a dedicated executive director for the first time.

This marks a new chapter as we recognize that The PHP Foundation has grown so much that we consider a dedicated management position to be required to ensure that our projects and goals are getting done.

If you are interested in the Executive Director role, we are still [looking for candidates to apply until December 15th, 2025](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/11/10/seeking-new-executive-director/).

Furthermore, we’d like to add 2 new developers to our team who applied to our program in autumn.

And mainly, our team will continue to maintain, document, and improve PHP further with the next major release (8.6 or 9.0) coming at the end of 2026\.

Thank you,   
The PHP Foundation
