Redesign [php.net](https://www.php.net/)? We hear you. Let’s start small and ship something great: a refreshed PHP 8.5 release page. The [8.0-era page](https://externals.io/message/112026#112026) built with community contributors and [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?utm_source=thephp.foundation&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=phpstorm&utm_content=refreshing-php-release-webpage) set the tone for 8.x. It’s held up, but 8.5 is a good moment to modernize: modern, clean, fast, inspiring.

We’re opening a design contest and you, the community, will help choose the winner. Read on for how to enter.

## Prizes

* **🥇 Grand prize: USD $1,000 sponsored by JetBrains**
* Honorable mentions (credit in the footer of the page)

## What we’re looking for

A modern, lightweight design for the PHP 8.5 release page that:

* Keeps things simple: vanilla HTML/CSS, minimal/no JS, **no new build tools or frameworks**.
* Mobile-first & fast: responsive layouts, small assets, system fonts.
* Localizable: works with multiple languages, avoids text baked into images.
* Content-first: use existing [8.5 content](https://github.com/php/web-php/pull/1454) as data.
* On-brand: feels at home on php.net; tasteful, unobtrusive visuals.
* Maintainable: straightforward markup that future contributors can edit.

Nice-to-have: a visual approach that can evolve for future releases (e.g., PHP 9.x).

## What to submit

Please submit designs first (we’re not judging big code drops):

* Mockups or prototype (Issue to [php/web-php]( https://github.com/php/web-php/issues/new?template=design-contest.yml)).
* A short rationale (why this layout, how it meets the criteria).
* You can also link to PR with the implementation.   
  Keep the code small and clean. We won’t review large generated codebases.

## How to submit

Create a GitHub Issue in the [php/web-php](https://github.com/php/web-php) repository using [Design Contest template](https://github.com/php/web-php/issues/new?template=design-contest.yml):

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
    <img width="600" src="/assets/post-images/2025/contest_issue.png" class="shadow-md rounded-lg"/>
</div>

Include:  

* Link(s) to mockups/prototype  
* 3–5 screenshots (desktop/mobile)  
* Rationale (300–600 words)  
* Your name (and teammates, if any)
