Welcome to the eighth issue of _PHP Core Roundup_ series! This issue was supposed to bring the great news of PHP 8.2 release, but the PHP 8.2 release date was pushed to December 8, and yet this issue is still full of exciting new updates about what‚Äôs being discussed and improved in PHP. 

> The PHP Foundation currently supports six part-time PHP contributors who work on maintenance and new features for PHP. Maintenance is not limited to fixing bugs, but also includes work to reduce technical debt, making life easier for everyone working on PHP. The contributors funded by the PHP Foundation collaborate with other contributors on code, documentation, and discussions.

<br>
We publish the posts on our website, and you can subscribe to a newsletter; You don‚Äôt necessarily have to be a PHP Foundation backer to follow _PHP Core Roundup_.

## The PHP Foundation: Impact and Transparency Report 2022

[Roman Pronskiy](https://twitter.com/pronskiy) wrote a detailed post on PHP Foundation‚Äôs impact, timeline, a summary of contributions made to PHP by PHP Foundation team, governance, financials, and more on [The PHP Foundation: Impact and Transparency Report 2022](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/11/22/transparency-and-impact-report-2022/).


## PHP 8.2 to be released on December 8

PHP 8.2 was scheduled to be released on 24th of November. However, because it falls on the US thanksgiving holiday, and to take some time to fix some bugs reported recently, PHP 8.2‚Äôs release managers [decided](https://externals.io/message/118991) to postpone the PHP 8.2 GA release to 8th of December. 


## All PHP 7 versions are now End-of-Life

PHP 7.4 is the last version in the PHP 7.4 series, and it reached its end of life on November 28th. This means that there will be no more bugs or security fixes. If you are running any PHP applications on PHP 7 make sure to upgrade to PHP 8, or to obtain Long-term support from a vendor. PHP 7 [still holds](https://php.watch/news/2021/11/php7-eol#stats) (based on [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org/php-statistics) and [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) data) the major usage share, so this is alarming. 

## Recent RFCs, Merged PRs, Discussions, and Commits

> Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP [issue tracker](https://github.com/php/php-src/issues), changes are discussed in [mailing lists](https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php), minor code changes are proposed as [pull requests](https://github.com/php/php-src/issues), and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as [PHP RFCs](https://wiki.php.net/rfc). [Documentation](https://github.com/php/doc-en/) and the [php.net website](https://github.com/php/web-php) changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.

<br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with üíú are done by the PHP Foundation team.

### RFC Updates

Following are the RFCs and major pull-requests discussed, voted, and implemented since our last update. 

* **RFC Implemented: [Improve unserialize() error handling](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/improve_unserialize_error_handling)**
	
	RFC by Tim D√ºsterhus, also mentioned in PHP Core Roundup Issue #7, is now implemented in PHP 8.3. This includes improving error handling of the <code>[unserialize()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php)</code> function by increasing the error level from <code>E_NOTICE</code> to <code>E_WARNING</code>. 
	
	More information on [PHP.Watch: unserialize(): Upgrade E_NOTICE errors to E_WARNING](https://php.watch/versions/8.3/unserialize-E-WARNING).

* **RFC Declined: [Destructuring Coalesce](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/destructuring_coalesce)**
	
	Bob Weinand proposed to allow coalescing in array destructing with `[$a ?? $b] = $array;`, where `$a` is assigned `$b` if the key in the array is null or missing. This RFC vote did not reach the required ‚Öî majority, and was declined.

* **RFC Under Discussion: [More Appropriate Date/Time Exceptions](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/datetime-exceptions) üíú**
	
	RFC by Derick Rethans, proposes to introduce Date/Time extension-specific exceptions and errors. This detailed RFC suggests more specificity in the exceptions with exception classes such as `DateInvalidTimeZoneException`, and `DateMalformedPeriodStringException` as well as promoting some of the current PHP warnings to Error exceptions.
	
	Vincent Langlet also started a related [mailing list discussion](https://externals.io/message/119019) about a week prior to this RFC.

* **RFC Under Discussion: [Readonly amendments](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/readonly_amendments) üíú**
	
	RFC by Nicolas Grekas and M√°t√© Kocsis, attempts to address the shortcomings of PHP 8.1 readonly properties and 8.2 readonly classes.
	
	This RFC proposes allowing `readonly` classes to be extended by non-readonly classes (currently not allowed, and causes a fatal error):
    ```php
    readonly class A {}
    class B extends A {} // Currently this produces a Fatal error
    ```
    <br>

    ... and to allow reinitializing readonly properties during cloning (within the `__clone()` magic method):
    ```php
    class Foo {
        public function __construct(
            public readonly DateTime $bar,
            public readonly DateTime $baz
        ) {}
     
        public function __clone()
        {
            $this->bar = clone $this->bar; // Works
            $this->cloneBaz();
        }
     
        public function cloneBaz()
        {
            $this->baz = clone $this->baz; // Also works
        }
    }
     
    $foo = new Foo(new DateTime(), new DateTime());
    $foo2 = clone $foo;
     
    // No error, Foo::$bar and Foo::$baz are cloned deeply
    ```
    <br>

* **RFC Accepted: [Randomizer Additions](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/randomizer_additions)**
	
	RFC by Joshua R√ºsweg and Tim D√ºsterhus, proposes to add new ‚Äúbuilding block‚Äù methods to `\Random\Randomizer` (added in PHP 8.2) that implement commonly useful operations that are either verbose or very hard to implement in userland.
	
	The RFC proposes to add two new methods: `getBytesFromString`, to generate a random string containing specific characters, and `getFloat`/`nextFloat`, to generate a random floating point value.
	The vote was accepted, and is pending implementation.
	
* **RFC Under Discussion: [Arbitrary static variable initializers](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/arbitrary_static_variable_initializers) üíú**

	RFC by Ilija Tovilo, proposing a series of changes and improvements to static variables in PHP.
	
	The RFC suggests static variable initializers to contain arbitrary expressions. Currently, static variables can only be initialized with constant expressions:
	
	```php
	function foo() {
        static $p = 16; // Allowed
        static $p = getValue(); // Not allowed, proposed to allow
    }
    ```
	<br />
    Further, it also proposes to disallow redeclaring static variables (in the scope of the same function) at compile-time with a fatal error, along with some changes in the Reflection API to account for the changes.
	
### Notable Mailing List Discussions

* [Microseconds to error log](https://externals.io/message/118865)
* [Remove warning when parsing datetime with + symbol](https://externals.io/message/119025)
* [Asymmetric Visibility, with readonly](https://externals.io/message/118994)
