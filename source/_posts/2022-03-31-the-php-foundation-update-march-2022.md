```<?php echo 'Hello world!';```

We promised to publish monthly updates, but something everything went wrong in February.

Thank you all for being understanding about the lack of update in February. This post will bring you all up to date on everything that's been accomplished since our last post in January.


### PHP Foundation Core Developers

One of our primary goals for 2022 is to find and hire developers to work on the core.

We are excited to reveal our initial group of sponsored developers!



* **Arnaud Le Blanc** [@arnaud-lb](https://github.com/arnaud-lb)
* **Derick Rethans** [@derickr](https://github.com/derickr)
* **George Peter Banyard** [@Girgias](https://github.com/Girgias)
* **Ilija Tovilo** [@iluuu1994](https://github.com/iluuu1994)
* **Jakub Zelenka** [@bukka](https://github.com/bukka)
* **Máté Kocsis** [@kocsismate](https://github.com/kocsismate)

You might be surprised to see Derick Rethans’ name in the list above. After all, he was listed as a PHP Fellow when we announced the Foundation last year. Shortly after we launched the Foundation, Derick informed us of his desire to focus his work on developing and maintaining PHP's core and that he wanted to apply for sponsorship from the Foundation to make this happen. To avoid any conflicts of interest, Derick stepped down from his administrative role before he applied for sponsorship.

We are incredibly happy that these core developers have agreed to join the Foundation, and we are looking forward to the great things we can do together.


### Code of Conduct

All participants of the PHP Foundation including administration members and developers are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contributor-covenant.org%2Fversion%2F2%2F1%2Fcode_of_conduct%2F).

To ensure enforcement of the Code of Conduct we are setting up a dedicated team. Tobias Nyholm [@Nyholm](https://github.com/Nyholm), who leads [Symfony’s CARE team](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsymfony.com%2Fcare), will be responsible for assembling and running the Foundation’s CoC team. Welcome aboard, Tobias!


### What’s next

Our main goal for the next month is to set up a proper communication and development process. We will conduct several meetings to discuss technical and organizational matters.

Since the purpose of the Foundation is to train the next generation of internal developers, we want to emphasize maintenance and user-focused features to maximize our impact. As such, we will review the efforts and ensure the plans fall in line with such an agenda.

We would also like to reduce the bus factor of PHP. So whenever possible, developers will be expected to update the [PHP Internals Book](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phpinternalsbook.com%2F) to ensure that no knowledge is lost.

On the administration side, we plan to work on increasing the transparency of our operations: to shed some light on the governance structure, discussions, and so on.


### PHP Foundation stands with Ukraine 🇺🇦

On February 24th, 2022, Vladimir Putin's Regime began an illegal war of aggression in Ukraine. There are no words to truly express our outrage at such disregard for human life.

Many PHP developers have lived in or are living in Ukraine, and the PHP Foundation is supported by many backers from Ukraine, including sponsors [Oro, Inc.](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Foroinc.com%2Flets-stop-the-war-together%2F) and [MacPaw](https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmacpaw.com%2F).

If you, like many in the PHP Foundation, are desperate to find a way to help, there are some organizations listed below that are working to provide humanitarian aid to people who are caught up in this war.

We are proud that many of our sponsors stand with Ukraine too. Here are just a few examples:
