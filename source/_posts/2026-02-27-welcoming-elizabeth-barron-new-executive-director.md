We're excited to welcome [Elizabeth Barron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethn) as the next Executive Director of The PHP Foundation, following a thorough process led by our search committee of [Nils Adermann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilsadermann/), [Sebastian Bergmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-bergmann-phpunit), [Lorna Mitchell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lornajane/), and [Ben Ramsey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benramsey/).

Elizabeth brings a rare combination of deep roots in the PHP community and proven leadership in open-source governance. She co-founded a volunteer-based nonprofit dedicated to supporting women and non-binary individuals in the PHP industry, served as Community Manager at GitHub where she led developer outreach programs including the Patchwork initiative, and has been active in CHAOSS – a project focused on open-source community health metrics.

Her experience spanning community building, fundraising, outreach operations, and open-source strategy makes her a natural fit to lead the foundation into its next chapter.

As previously announced, founding Executive Director [Roman Pronskiy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pronskiy/) is transitioning to focus on his growing role at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), while continuing to serve on the Board of Directors. Roman will work closely with Elizabeth to ensure a smooth handover.
