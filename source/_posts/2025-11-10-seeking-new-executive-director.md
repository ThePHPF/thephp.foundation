We're opening the search for our next Executive Director, marking an important milestone in the continued growth and evolution of the PHP Foundation.

After four years at the helm of the PHP Foundation, [Roman Pronskiy](https://x.com/pronskiy) will conclude his tenure as Executive Director in early 2026. Roman founded and helped build the Foundation from the ground up into a stable, well-run organization, expanded our team of core developers, and deepened collaboration across the PHP ecosystem. As his role at JetBrains grows, Roman has decided to focus his efforts there while continuing to support the PHP Foundation’s next chapter.

We’re immensely grateful for Roman’s vision and leadership, which shaped the foundation’s first years and set a strong course for the future. He will continue serving on the Board of Directors as JetBrains’ representative, providing continuity as JetBrains remains a platinum sponsor and steadfast supporter of PHP. Roman will work closely with the incoming Executive Director to make the transition smooth and complete.

The Board has formed a search committee consisting of two board members Sebastian Bergmann and Nils Adermann as well as two community representatives Lorna Jane Mitchell and Ben Ramsey. The search committee will manage the selection process and find a leader who can build on the Foundation's momentum and guide us through our next phase of growth.

**What we're looking for:**

* Strong leadership experience in open source communities
* Deep knowledge of the PHP ecosystem
* Excellent project management and communication skills
* Strategic thinking and a vision for the foundation's future
* Experience working with diverse stakeholders and sponsors

This is an opportunity to shape the future of one of the world's most widely-used programming languages and support the vibrant community that sustains it.

**How you can help:**

We need the PHP community's help in finding the right person for this role. If you know someone who would be an excellent Executive Director for the PHP Foundation, please encourage them to apply or reach out to us directly.

The full job description and application details can be found below.
