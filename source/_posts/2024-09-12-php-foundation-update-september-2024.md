```<?= 'Hello world!';```

Here are some updates we’d like to share with you.

## Generics Research Progress

One of our most anticipated projects is the research into generics for PHP. In August, we published a [comprehensive report on the state of generics and collections in PHP](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/08/19/state-of-generics-and-collections/). This research is a crucial step towards potentially implementing generics in future PHP.  The further direction has not been decided yet, so we encourage the PHP community to review the report and provide feedback.

## Welcoming Ben Marks as Official PHP Foundation Ambassador

We are thrilled to announce that [Ben Marks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhmarks/) has stepped up as the official PHP Foundation ambassador. Ben is Director Global Market Development at Shopware, and  was a co-Founder of the Magento Association.

In this role, Ben will:

* Serve as a liaison between the Foundation and the broader PHP community.
* Represent the Foundation at conferences and events.
* Help communicate our initiatives and gather feedback from the community.

We're confident that Ben's contributions will strengthen our connections within the PHP world and help us better serve the community's needs.

Please give Ben a warm welcome\!

## Website Updates in Progress

We’d like to make sure our ***[thephp.foundation](https://thephp.foundation)*** website provides clear information about what we do, how sponsors can support the foundation, and what are the benefits on top of supporting the PHP language maintenance and development. Please share what you think is missing on the website or is not clearly described. Roast the website so we can improve\!
