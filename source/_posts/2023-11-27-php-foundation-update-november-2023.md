```<?php echo 'Hello world!';```

This post provides insights into The PHP Foundation's recent activities.

> My name is Roman Pronskiy. I‚Äôm sponsored by [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com/) to manage operations at the PHP Foundation. Reach out to me at pronskiy@thephp.foundation.

## Team Growth

In September, we initiated an open call for new developers to join the PHP Foundation by launching an [application form](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2023/09/06/application-form-2023/).

We received a total of 207 applications. From this pool, we selected a shortlist of 12 qualified candidates. Following a comprehensive review and input from existing foundation members, we further refined our selection to 4 outstanding individuals. We will soon announce the new members.

The primary focus for the new developers will be on the maintenance and modernization of PHP‚Äôs infrastructure ‚Äî a critical step towards ensuring PHP being a robust and forward-looking language.

The public work undertaken by our developers can be followed in our monthly ["PHP Core Roundup"](https://thephp.foundation/blog/tag/roundup/) series, which highlights the ongoing progress and developments within PHP core.


## Advisory Board

For our major sponsors, we offer exclusive insights through occasional digests that provide a deeper dive into discussions, debates, and early-stage developments. This not only keeps our sponsors abreast of the latest happenings but also allows them to see the direct impact of their support. This is one of the benefits of being an Advisory Board member.

We announced the advisory board initiative [in March](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2023/03/31/php-foundation-update-march-2023/#a-new-benefit-for-major-sponsors-%E2%80%93-advisory-board-membership). Since then, 9 companies have joined the initiative with their representatives.

These are the current Advisory Board members: Moodle, Shopware, Laravel, Automattic, Ardennes-√©tape, Les-Tilleuls.coop / API Platform, Aternos GmbH, PrestaShop, CraftCMS.

There were several useful discussions within the group. Specifically, we‚Äôd like to highlight the one around [Property Hooks RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks). The Advisory Board feedback helped to shape the proposal design significantly.

By the way, you can already try property hooks on [3v4l.org](https://3v4l.org/), thanks to [Sjon Hortensius](https://github.com/sponsors/SjonHortensius).

## Sovereign Tech Fund invests in PHP

[Sovereign Tech Fund](https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/) is an organization that supports the development, improvement, and maintenance of digital infrastructure. Their goal is to sustainably strengthen the open-source ecosystem, with a focus on security, resilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the projects. STF is financed by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action.

We have collaborated with STF to create work plans for these specific projects: PECL overhaul, Testing tool for FPM, Security Audit, and Documentation improvements.

We‚Äôll share more details on each project early next year, and for now we are thrilled and grateful to the Sovereign Tech Fund for trusting us.


## Security audit of PHP is coming

As mentioned above, STF is investing in PHP, and we are going to commission an audit of PHP's C code base. We expect security issues to be found. To mitigate possible bad perception, we aim to publish and fix the revealed security issues at the same time.

For this security audit, we are partnering with [The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc](https://ostif.org/) (OSTIF), a corporate non-profit dedicated to securing critical open-source projects. They have a proven track record of audits for [popular open-source projects](https://github.com/ostif-org/OSTIF/blob/main/Completed-Engagements.md) such as cURL, Git, Linux Kernel, OpenSSL, Node.js, and others.


## Reports schedule

Although we promised to prepare quarterly reports, that unfortunately did not happen to be feasible. So for 2023, we fall back to one yearly report. The 2023 transparency report will be published in December.


## Meet us at the conferences

You can meet our team at the following conferences in late 2023:

**[betterCode(PHP)](https://php.bettercode.eu/) ‚Äì Nov 27**

Jakub Zalenka will give a talk: "PHP 8.3: Changes and future plans". <br> 
Besides Jakub, there will be talks from Niels Dossche and Sebastian Bergmann.

**[SymfonyCon Brussels](https://live.symfony.com/2023-brussels-con/) ‚Äì Dec 7‚Äì8**
