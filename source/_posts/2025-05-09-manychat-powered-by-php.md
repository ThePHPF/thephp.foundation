At the PHP Foundation, we’re proud to be supported by companies that build amazing products and contribute back to the PHP ecosystem. Today, we’d like to highlight [Manychat](https://manychat.com/) — one of our Silver sponsors.

Manychat is the world’s leading chat marketing platform, helping businesses connect with their customers on Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and beyond. With over **1 billion conversations powered every year** across **170+ countries**, Manychat is a great example of how PHP scales and supports high-traffic applications around the world.

## Why PHP? Because Speed Wins

In their recently published case study — _[How Manychat Scaled to 1 Billion Conversations Using PHP](https://medium.com/manychat-engineering/how-manychat-scaled-to-1-billion-conversations-using-php-a-startups-guide-to-smart-tech-choices-781c74f16f23)_ — the Manychat team shares the story of how PHP helped them go from a tiny startup with just one developer to a platform supporting millions of users.

> _“We could build right away — our only developer already knew PHP, so we skipped onboarding and got straight to work.”_

By choosing PHP, Manychat was able to build their MVP in just a few days and start learning from real users immediately. As they grew, they faced the familiar scaling challenges of high traffic, heavy workloads, and resource management. Their case study provides mentions architectural decisions they made — from using asynchronous request handling with NGINX + Lua, to optimizing background task processing with PHP-CLI workers, and managing database connections efficiently with PgBouncer.

## PHP at the Heart of a Global Platform

Today, Manychat’s platform continues to run on PHP, handling millions of API calls and conversations while keeping infrastructure costs under control.

If you’re excited about building products that reach millions and love working with PHP at scale, check out the [open positions at Manychat](https://careers.manychat.com/positions). They’re hiring PHP engineers!

## Supporting the Community

Manychat isn’t just building with PHP — they’re giving back to the community. As a **Silver sponsor** of the PHP Foundation, they help us fund initiatives that keep PHP stable, modern, and accessible to millions of developers worldwide.

In addition, Manychat is active in the tech community, hosting [PHP meetups and events](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/manychat-46565622503) in **Barcelona** and **Amsterdam**. We love seeing our sponsors not only build great products but also foster connections between developers around the world.
