As 2024 comes to a close, we at the PHP Foundation want to take a moment to thank everyone who has supported us this year. It‚Äôs been an incredible journey, and we couldn‚Äôt have done it without the amazing PHP community and our generous sponsors.

## A Year of Milestones

In [its third year](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/22/php-foundation-turns-three), the PHP Foundation has achieved several milestones that have further strengthened the PHP ecosystem: first in a decade [security audit](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/22/php-foundation-turns-three/#feature-development-is-only-about-20%25-of-what-the-foundation-team-does), [pie](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/), numerous features and improvements for [PHP 8.4](https://www.php.net/releases/8.4/en.php), and much more to come next year!
