Hey there, PHP enthusiasts and tech leaders\! It's that time of the year again when everyone's crunching numbers and deciding on budgets. We've got an opportunity for you to make a real impact on the PHP ecosystem. Let's dive in.

## Join us\! Fund the Future of Web Development

We just opened applications for PHP core language contributors: [The PHP Foundation application form for 2025 is now open](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/09/17/application-form-2025/).

Here's the deal: **the more sponsors we get, the more ambitious we can be with our plans**. At a minimum, we finance maintenance and security support, but with more funding, we can continue high-reaching projects.

Your sponsorship could help us:

* **Tackle long-standing bugs** that have been bothering developers for ages.
* **Implement cool new features** that will make PHP even more awesome.
* **Improve performance and security** (because who doesn't want a faster PHP).

And if we get enough sponsors, we might even venture into some experimental territory. Your support could lead to the next big breakthrough in PHP development.

quote: 'To achieve exceptional performance and simplify application deployment, FrankenPHP pushes the PHP engine to its limits and uses it in atypical ways (ZTS, musl libc, specific timeout management...). 

This would not be possible without the excellent work done by the&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;Foundation\'s team: they correct the problems we report, continuously improve performance and make the engine always more generic and modular, which not only enables us to innovate in FrankenPHP, but also benefits the entire ecosystem by making PHP faster and more reliable.

By sponsoring the foundation, you\'re investing in the future of PHP!'
}) }}

## 2025: The Year PHP Turns 30 (and It's Going to Be Epic\!)

PHP is turning 30 in 2025, and we're planning a special celebration\! By sponsoring the PHP Foundation, you'll be front and center for this milestone year. Here's what we've got cooking:

* A massive collaboration with the marketing teams from Laravel, JetBrains, and Zend by Perforce. It's like the Avengers of the PHP world coming together.
* A much-needed facelift for php.net. Let's make it shine for PHP’s 30th birthday\!

Imagine your company being visible as a part of this historic moment. Pretty cool, right?

## Why Sponsor the PHP Foundation?

You might be wondering, "Why should I sponsor the PHP Foundation?" Let us list some of the reasons:

1. **Visibility:** Your brand will be seen by millions of developers worldwide. That's a lot of eyeballs.
2. **Influence:** Help shape the future of one of the most widely used programming languages on the web.
3. **Security:** Without sufficient funding, the PHP language will lack the resources to promptly address bugs your company runs into.
4. **Recruitment:** Attract top PHP talent by showing your commitment to the language.
5. **Giving Back:** If PHP has helped your business grow, here's your chance to return the favor.
6. **Tech Cred:** Nothing says "we're serious about web development" like sponsoring a major programming language.
