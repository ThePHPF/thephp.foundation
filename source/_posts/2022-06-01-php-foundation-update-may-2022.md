```<?php echo 'Hello world!';```

This time our regular update is short. Check the [PHP Core Roundup](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/05/30/php-core-roundup-2/) series for a detailed development log.


## Interview with core developers

After the [April update](https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation/updates/php-foundation-update-april-2022), Sebastian Bergmann published an [interview with our sponsored core developers](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/05/06/interview-with-core-developers/): Derick Rethans, George Peter Banyard, Jakub Zelenka, Máté Kocsis, and Ilija Tovilo. The other day we updated it and added answers from Arnaud Le Blanc. Check [the interview](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/05/06/interview-with-core-developers/) to get a high-level picture of what guys are working on.


## PHP Core Roundup

In the [PHP Roundup #2](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/05/30/php-core-roundup-2/) post by Ayesh, you can find a detailed log of what's been done and discussed regarding the PHP engine this month.

We decided to rename the series from _PHP Roundup_ to _PHP Core Roundup_ to reflect the content better and emphasize that the roundup is only about the core of the language.

Send your questions about the roundup directly to roundup@thephp.foundation or simply tweet at us: [@ThePHPF](https://twitter.com/thephpf), [@Ayeshlive](https://twitter.com/Ayeshlive).
