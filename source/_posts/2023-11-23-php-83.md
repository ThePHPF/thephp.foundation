[PHP 8.3](https://www.php.net/releases/8.3) is here! Bringing a handful of new features, performance and functionality improvements, and a healthy amount of deprecations, PHP 8.3 was released today.

PHP 8.3 will continue to receive active support for two years, followed by one year of security updates. Similar to the PHP 8.2 upgrade, the PHP 8.3 upgrade will be smooth as backward compatiblity is maintained. While some functionality is deprecated, there are no syntax, API*, and remove functionality in this release.

## What's in PHP 8.3

Some of the major new features in PHP 8.3 include support for declaring a type for class constants, improvements to support deep-cloning of `readonly` properties, improvements to the new Random extension introduced in PHP 8.2, new [`json_validate()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-validate.php),[`str_increment()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-increment.php), and [`str_decrement()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-decrement.php), functions, and a noticeable amount of improvements in DateTime, DOM, and Intl extensions. 

See the [PHP 8.3 release page](https://www.php.net/releases/8.3) for what's new and changed in PHP 8.3.

> (*) Note that some of the PHP core extensions now declare types for built-in class constants. This is technically a BC break in case child classes declare the same constants without type declaration, which is only supported in PHP 8.3.

## Upgrade to PHP 8.3

PHP packages on software repositories such as Debian and Ubuntu repos maintained by [Ondřej Surý](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej), [Remi Collet](https://github.com/remicollet) for Fedora/RHEL/EL already contain PHP 8.3 builds ready to install.

Windows builds for PHP 8.3 are available on [windows.php.net](https://windows.php.net/download/)

[Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php) with PHP 8.3 will also be available on Docker hub in the coming days.
