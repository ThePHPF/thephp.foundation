Welcome to the seventh in the _PHP Core Roundup_ series, where we summarize the latest improvements, bug fixes, proposals, and other developments in PHP. 

We are merely three weeks away from PHP 8.2 GA release, and we already have changes implemented and being discussed for the next PHP version, PHP 8.3! Exciting times!

[![Right now, we are working on a transparency report, renewing contracts, and establishing high-level goals for next year. We have a lot of exciting stuff to share soon, so please stay tuned!](/assets/post-images/2022/roundup-7/tweet-thephpf-status.png "The PHP Foundation üíú on Twitter")](https://twitter.com/ThePHPF/status/1581716848944779264)

## First PHP 8.3 Changes Implemented!

PHP 8.3 is more than a year away, but the first change for PHP 8.3 is already merged into the `master` branch. 

Juan Carlos Morales‚Äôs RFC to add a new `json_validate()` function to PHP was voted and is already implemented. The new `json_validate()` function returns whether a given JSON string is valid or not, without consuming the memory and processing it takes to decode a JSON string. For quick JSON string validations, `json_validate()` can come in handy.

Additionally, Tim D√ºsterhus‚Äôs RFC to improve error handling semantics of the `unserialize()` function recently finished the vote.

There are quite a few more RFCs under discussion that target PHP 8.3, so it‚Äôs safe to say that the PHP 8.3 development is quite active even before we have the first GA PHP 8.2 release!


## PHP 8.2 GA to be released this month!

The first GA PHP version, PHP 8.2.0 is scheduled to be released on 24th of November. PHP 8.2 RC5 is already released, and RC6 (the last one) is scheduled for 10th of November.

PHP 8.2 RC versions are available in [Ondrej Sury‚Äôs](https://deb.sury.org/#php-packages) Debian/Ubuntu repos, [Remi‚Äôs](https://rpms.remirepo.net/) repos for Fedora/RHEL, [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags?page=1&name=8.2) on Docker Hub, and compiled Windows binaries on [windows.php.net](https://windows.php.net). 


## All PHP 7 Versions Reach EOL Next Month

PHP 7‚Äôs journey [comes to an end](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) when PHP 8.2 is released. PHP 7.0 through 7.3 are no longer maintained and no longer receive security updates, but PHP 7.4 is currently receiving security updates from the PHP core developers. 


## Recent RFCs, Merged PRs, Discussions, and Commits

> Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP [issue tracker](https://github.com/php/php-src/issues), changes are discussed in [mailing lists](https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php), minor code changes are proposed as [pull requests](https://github.com/php/php-src/issues), and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as [PHP RFCs](https://wiki.php.net/rfc). [Documentation](https://github.com/php/doc-en/) and the [php.net web site](https://github.com/php/web-php) changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.

<br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with üíú are done by the PHP Foundation team.

A security release for all current PHP versions (7.4, 8.0, and 8.1) were made fixing an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the GD extension (CVE-2022-31630), and a buffer overflow vulnerability in PHP‚Äôs SHA3 implementation (CVE-2022-37454). The SHA3 [vulnerability](https://mouha.be/sha-3-buffer-overflow/) was in the reference upstream SHA3 implementation written in C. Python and a few libraries were affected along with PHP.


### RFC Updates

Following are the RFCs and major pull-requests discussed, voted, and implemented since our last update. 

* **RFC Implemented: [json_validate](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/json_validate)**
	
	RFC by Juan Carlos Morales, to add a new `json_validate()` function that returns whether the given string of JSON is a valid JSON. This RFC‚Äôs vote passed, and is now implemented in PHP 8.3.
	
	There is a polyfill [proposed](https://github.com/symfony/polyfill/pull/416) to Symfony polyfills, and more information on [PHP.Watch: json_validate()](https://php.watch/versions/8.3/json_validate).

* **RFC Pending Implementation: [Improve unserialize() error handling](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/improve_unserialize_error_handling)**
	
	RFC by Tim D√ºsterhus completed its vote, and is pending implementation. It proposed to improve error handling of the unserialize function by increasing the error level from E_NOTICE to E_WARNING, adding a new '`UnserializationFailedException`' exception, and throwing exceptions on error conditions.
		
	The vote was not in favor of adding the new 'UnserializationFailedException' exception type, but the vote to promote notices to warnings was in favor, and is currently pending implementation.
	
	More information on [PHP.Watch: `unserialize()`: Upgrade `E_NOTICE` errors to `E_WARNING`](https://php.watch/versions/8.3/unserialize-E-WARNING).

* **RFC Under Discussion: [Destructuring Coalesce](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/destructuring_coalesce)**
	
	Bob Weinand created a new RFC and a [discussion](https://externals.io/message/118829) on allowing `[$a ?? $b] = $array;`, where `$a` is assigned `$b` if the key in the array is null or missing:
	
	```php
	[$a ?? $b] = $array;
	[$a ?? "default value"] = $array;
	```
	<br />
	Currently, the snippets above result in Parse Error. The RFC proposes adding support for coalesce in array destructing (`list()` function calls, or `[$a, $b, ‚Ä¶] = $array` syntax).

	When destructing an array, the `$a` will be assigned `$b`/`"default value"` if `$array[0]` is not set.

* **RFC Under Discussion: [Randomizer Additions](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/randomizer_additions)**
	
	RFC by Joshua R√ºsweg and Tim D√ºsterhus, proposes to add new ‚Äúbuilding block‚Äù methods to `\Random\Randomizer` that implement commonly useful operations that are either verbose or very hard to implement in userland. It proposes to add `getBytesFromString`, `nextFloat`, and `getFloat` methods to the new `\Random\Randomizer` classes added as part of the [Random Extension](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/rng_extension) RFC.

* **RFC Under Discussion: [Dynamic class constant fetch](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dynamic_class_constant_fetch)**
	
	In this RFC, Ilija Tovilo üíú proposes to allow fetching class constants and magic constants dynamically.
	
	```php
	class Foo {
    	const BAR = 'bar';
    }
	
    $bar = 'BAR';

    // This is currently a syntax error
    echo Foo::{$bar};
    ```
	
	<br />
	Currently, accessing class constants dynamically has to be done with a constant() function call:
	
	```php
	echo constant(Foo::class . '::' . $bar);
	```
	
	<br />
	This RFC proposes to allow the syntax shown in the snippet above, which is apparently only an arbitrary limitation and not a technical limitation.
