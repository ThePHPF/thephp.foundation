The PHP Foundation is pleased to announce the completion of a comprehensive security audit of the PHP source code ([php/php-src](https://github.com/php/php-src)), **commissioned by the [Sovereign Tech Agency](https://www.sovereign.tech/)**.

This initiative was organized in partnership with the [Open Source Technology Improvement Fund](https://ostif.org/) (OSTIF) and executed by the esteemed security group [Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/).

## Audit Overview

Conducted over a two-month period in 2024, the audit encompassed:

* Development of a threat model tailored to php-src
* Manual code reviews
* Dynamic testing procedures
* Cryptographic assessments

The collaboration between Quarkslab‚Äôs auditors and PHP maintainers ensured a thorough examination of the codebase.

Due to budget constraints, the recent security audit focused on the most critical components of the PHP source code rather than the entire codebase. Organizations interested in sponsoring a comprehensive audit or additional assessments are encouraged to [contact us](mailto:contact@thephp.foundation)!

## Key Findings

The audit identified 27 issues, with 17 having security implications:

* 3 High-severity
* 5 Medium-severity
* 9 Low-severity

Additionally, 10 informational findings were reported.

Notably, four vulnerabilities received CVE identifiers:

* CVE-2024-9026: Log tampering vulnerability in PHP-FPM, allowing potential manipulation or removal of characters from log messages.
* CVE-2024-8925: Flaw in PHP‚Äôs multipart form data parsing, potentially leading to data misinterpretation.
* CVE-2024-8929: Issue where a malicious MySQL server could cause the client to disclose heap content from other SQL requests.

## Recommendations and Resolutions

Quarkslab‚Äôs report commended the overall high quality and specification adherence of the php/php-src project.

The PHP development team has addressed all identified issues. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest PHP versions to benefit from these security enhancements.
