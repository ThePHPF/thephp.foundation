On June 8, 1995, Rasmus Lerdorf released the first version of the PHP language. Over time, PHP has become the most popular server-side programming language, now powering over 70% of websites!

Exactly 30 years after the first release of PHP, we are proud to announce that [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev), a modern and high-performance application server based on Caddy, is now part of [the PHP organisation on GitHub](https://github.com/php/frankenphp).

As a reminder, FrankenPHP offers features that are unique in the PHP ecosystem:

* simplify the development of applications written in PHP;
* drastically improve performance, while considerably reducing hosting costs (FinOps) and energy consumption (GreenOps);
* facilitate deployment in production, whether on bare-metal servers, or in cloud-native environments;
* easily develop real-time features thanks to native [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks) protocol support;
* extend PHP apps with Go, C, and C++ programming languages;
* support the PHP programming language in any application written in Go (server, proxy, in-house development‚Ä¶).

The move of FrankenPHP into the PHP organisation follows the announcement of FrankenPHP support by the PHP Foundation, in collaboration with [Les-Tilleuls.coop](https://les-tilleuls.coop) (the creator of FrankenPHP) and the team maintaining [the Caddy web server](https://caddyserver.com).  

This is the first step towards greater integration of the tool into the language ecosystem.

The roadmap and new features that are likely to change the way PHP applications are developed will be announced at the **[JetBrains PHPverse 2025](https://jb.gg/phpverse-phpf)** online conference on **June 17**, to celebrate PHP's 30th birthday. There is still time to register, and it's free!
