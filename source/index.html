			<p>
				The <strong>PHP Foundation</strong> is a collective established with the
				non-profit mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP
				language. We are a community of PHP veterans, community
				leaders, and technology companies that rely on PHP as a
				critical digital infrastructure. We collaborate to ensure
				PHP language long-term success and maintenance.
			</p>

			<p>
				People and businesses may come and go, so it is vital to
				ensure that the PHP source code will survive beyond the
				current contributor base. We wish to contribute to the
				creation and maintenance of a stable language for
				generations to come.
			</p>

			<p>
				The formation of the PHP Foundation was announced in
				November 2021 and the PHP Foundation initiative runs with
				the administration whose goal is to find such an
				organization structure that will ensure a long-term
				sustainability of the PHP language development.

		<div class="mt-4 sm:pl-12 sm:pr-12">
			<p>
				The current group collective administration focuses on maintaining the
				continuity of the PHP project, in particular on hiring, supporting, and
				guiding PHP project developers. The Administration also encourages
				other Financial Contributors and explores strategic partnerships and
				needs for the PHP project.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Administrator consists of veteran PHP core developers, PHP
				community leaders, representatives of the founding companies, and other
				key stakeholders. In 2022, this is an invitation-only group, while
				weâ€™re working to get our processes solidified.
			</p>

			<p>
				To promote transparency, we operate as <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation">a collective on the Open
				Collective platform</a>,
				through which we ensure certain activities, such as selection and
				financing of PHP core developers contributing to the development of the
				PHP language. The decisions about these activities are taken by
				consensus by the administration members, which meet regularly, and are
				executed by the collective administrators.
			</p>

			<p>
				All administration members of the PHP Foundation as well as
				contributors and PHP developers are expected to abide by the <a href="code_of_conduct">Code of
				Conduct</a>
				and follow our collective expectations guidelines and <a href="https://opencollective.com/tos">Terms of
				Service</a> of the platform operated by
				Open Collective Inc.

                The primary task of the PHP Foundation is to fund developers to work on
                PHP. Funds collected through the Open Collective platform may be used
                in the first place to engage the services of PHP developers in order to
                further advance the development and maintenance of the language.
            </p>

            <p>
                The current Request for Comments (RFC) is not affiliated to the PHP
                Foundation, and the language decisions are the matter of the PHP
                Internals community.
