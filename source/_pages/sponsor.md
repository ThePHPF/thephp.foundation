## Yearly and Monthly Sponsorships for The PHP Foundation

You can achieve Silver, Gold, or Platinum status by making financial contributions throughout the year. Contributions can be made annually, quarterly, or monthly.

- Once your contributions exceed a certain sponsorship level threshold, either through a one-time donation or cumulative monthly contributions, you immediately become a sponsor at that level.

- Sponsors are removed from the list at the end of each calendar year if their total contributions for that year do not meet the threshold for their level.

For example, if you contribute $1,500 monthly in 2024, your total contribution by September will be $12,000, qualifying you as a Silver member for the rest of 2024 and all of 2025.
