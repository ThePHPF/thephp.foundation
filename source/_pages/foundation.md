## Governance

The current group collective administration focuses on maintaining the continuity of the PHP project, 
in particular on hiring, supporting, and guiding PHP project developers. 
The Administration also encourages other Financial Contributors and explores strategic partnerships and needs for the PHP project.

The Administration consists of veteran PHP core developers, PHP community leaders, 
representatives of the founding companies, and other key stakeholders. 
In 2022, this is an invitation-only group, while weâ€™re working to get our processes solidified.

To promote transparency, we operate as a [collective on the Open Collective platform](https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation), 
through which we ensure certain activities, such as selection and financing of PHP core developers contributing
to the development of the PHP language. The decisions about these activities are taken by
consensus by the administration members, which meet regularly, and are executed by the
collective administrators.

All administration members of the PHP Foundation as well as contributors and PHP developers are
    expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) and follow our collective expectations
    guidelines and [Terms of Service](https://opencollective.com/tos) of the platform operated by Open Collective Inc.

## Foundation Activities

The primary task of the PHP Foundation is to fund developers to work on PHP. Funds collected
through the Open Collective platform may be used in the first place to engage the services of
PHP developers to further advance the development and maintenance of the language.

The current Request for Comments (RFC) is not affiliated to the PHP Foundation, and the language
decisions are the matter of the PHP Internals community.

## Team Timeline

We established the following timeline for team review. 

* January 2024: Developers start work according to the new contracts.  
* May 2024: Evaluate new developers, contracts are extended, expanded, or terminated after the first 6 months.  
* September 2024: Open applications for new developers, evaluate performance of the current group of developers.  
* October 2024: Evaluate applications, work out updates to compensation, decide on a budget.  
* November 2024: Renew contracts with existing developers, potentially sign contracts with new developers.  

And in 2025 we start the cycle again.
