### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

CoC Active Response Ensurers (CARE) team members
are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable
behavior **within the scope of PHP Foundation activities and spaces**. 
They are not responsible for adjudicating disputes or behaviors occurring in external communities or organizations, unless those actions directly affect the Foundation’s activities or its community spaces.

CARE team members have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all PHP Foundation-managed spaces (e.g., events, repositories, communication channels) and to all individuals officially representing the Foundation in those contexts.

It does not extend to actions or disputes occurring solely within third-party communities or companies unless those actions directly and substantially affect Foundation operations or participants in our spaces.

### Sponsorship and Membership

Sponsorship of the PHP Foundation is a financial contribution that supports our mission. Sponsorship does not imply governance rights, or endorsement of the sponsor’s actions, products, or policies.

Members of the Foundation (e.g., Staff, Board and Advisory Board participants) are expected to uphold the Code of Conduct in all Foundation-related contexts. However, the Foundation does not assume responsibility for the actions of these individuals or their companies outside the scope of Foundation activities, unless those actions materially impact the Foundation’s work or violate this Code in our official spaces.

### Neutrality

The PHP Foundation maintains a position of neutrality in disputes between companies, communities, and individuals within the broader PHP ecosystem. We focus on supporting PHP’s development and growth. The Foundation will not intervene in external disputes unless directly required to protect its contributors, events, or resources.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the CARE team members. All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated promptly and fairly.

CARE team members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

The CARE team members will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in
determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code
of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from a CARE team member,
providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an
explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology
may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction
with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing
the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding
interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media.
Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards,
including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or
aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.
