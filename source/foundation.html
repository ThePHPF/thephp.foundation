                    <p>The current group collective administration focuses on maintaining the continuity of the PHP
                        project, in particular on hiring, supporting, and guiding PHP project developers. The
                        Administration also encourages other Financial Contributors and explores strategic partnerships
                        and needs for the PHP project.</p>

                    <p>The Administration consists of veteran PHP core developers, PHP community leaders,
                        representatives of the founding companies, and other key stakeholders. In 2022, this is an
                        invitation-only group, while weâ€™re working to get our processes solidified.</p>

                    <p>To promote transparency, we operate as
                        <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a
                            collective on the Open Collective platform</a>, through which we
                        ensure certain activities, such as selection and financing of PHP core developers contributing
                        to the development of the PHP language. The decisions about these activities are taken by
                        consensus by the administration members, which meet regularly, and are executed by the
                        collective administrators.</p>

                    <p>All administration members of the PHP Foundation as well as contributors and PHP developers are
                        expected to abide by the

                    <p>The primary task of the PHP Foundation is to fund developers to work on PHP. Funds collected
                        through the Open Collective platform may be used in the first place to engage the services of
                        PHP developers in order to further advance the development and maintenance of the language.</p>

                    <p>The current Request for Comments (RFC) is not affiliated to the PHP Foundation, and the language
                        decisions are the matter of the PHP Internals community.</p>
