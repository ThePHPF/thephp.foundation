                        <p>The current group collective administration focuses on maintaining the continuity of the PHP
                            project, in particular on hiring, supporting, and guiding PHP project developers. The
                            Administration also encourages other Financial Contributors and explores strategic partnerships
                            and needs for the PHP project.</p>

                        <p>The Administration consists of veteran PHP core developers, PHP community leaders,
                            representatives of the founding companies, and other key stakeholders. In 2022, this is an
                            invitation-only group, while we’re working to get our processes solidified.</p>

                        <p>To promote transparency, we operate as
                            <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a
                                collective on the Open Collective platform</a>, through which we
                            ensure certain activities, such as selection and financing of PHP core developers contributing
                            to the development of the PHP language. The decisions about these activities are taken by
                            consensus by the administration members, which meet regularly, and are executed by the
                            collective administrators.</p>

                        <p>All administration members of the PHP Foundation as well as contributors and PHP developers are
                            expected to abide by the

                        <p>The primary task of the PHP Foundation is to fund developers to work on PHP. Funds collected
                            through the Open Collective platform may be used in the first place to engage the services of
                            PHP developers in order to further advance the development and maintenance of the language.</p>

                        <p>The current Request for Comments (RFC) is not affiliated to the PHP Foundation, and the language
                            decisions are the matter of the PHP Internals community.</p>
