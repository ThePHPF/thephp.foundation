<h2 id="php-core-roundup">PHP Core Roundup</h2>

<p>In July, we marked the feature-freeze for PHP 8.2, and this next version of PHP is being shaped by PHP Foundation members and all the contributors to be an exciting release!</p>

<p>Catch up to this month's PHP Core changes on the <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/07/28/php-core-roundup-4/">PHP Core Roundup #4</a></strong> post by Ayesh, where you can find a detailed log of what's been done and discussed regarding the PHP engine.</p>

<p><strong>What if our proposal did not make it?</strong></p>

<p>Among many fixes and improvements, some suggestions did not pass the RFC voting barrier. For instance, that happened to the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/auto-capture-closure">Short Closures 2.0</a> proposal.</p>

<p>We consider this a good experience in any case, and developers might reconsider, improve, and suggest it in the next release cycle, i.e., PHP 8.3.</p>

<p>We also consider it to be a good thing that it's difficult to change the language, as these changes are forever.</p>

<p><strong>What about deprecations?</strong></p>

<p>PHP has a long 25-year history, and no wonder it has some old quirks. One of them relates to DateTime and DateTimeImmutable confusion.</p>

<p>Derrick Rethans, a core developer of the PHP Foundation, asks for an opinion about in which way this confusion should be resolved; if it should:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Making PHP&#39;s DateTime class mutable was one of the bigger mistakes of the Date/Time APIs. I&#39;m considering to change DateTime to be immutable by default in PHP 9, and to drop DateTimeImmutable altogether (or make it an alias). This is likely going to break some code. Opinions?</p>&mdash; Derick Rethans (@derickr) <a href="https://twitter.com/derickr/status/1551611856007069696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2022</a></blockquote>

Can you believe it? Just three years (and one day) ago, PHP had no organization behind it. Only two people were being paid to work on the language that powers 70% of the web.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the very first announcement about the creation of the PHP Foundation: 
<a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/">The New Life of PHP ‚Äì The PHP Foundation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fast-forward-to-today">Fast forward to today</h2>

<p>We now have a team of 10 talented engineers dedicated to PHP. We‚Äôre supported by major companies, governments, and an incredible community. That same community is creating amazing projects with PHP, while businesses continue to thrive thanks to a mature, secure, and performant language.</p>

<p>Since 2021, we‚Äôve seen three PHP releases‚ÄîPHP 8.2, 8.3, and the freshly released <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.4/en.php">PHP 8.4</a>. Here are just a few highlights from these releases, developed by the PHP Foundation team:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property hooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/asymmetric-visibility-v2">Asymmetric Visibility</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/lazy-objects">Lazy Objects</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/">New tool for installing extensions: pie</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="feature-development-is-only-about-20%25-of-what-the-foundation-team-does">Feature development is only about 20% of what the foundation team does</h2>

<p>Behind the scenes, there‚Äôs a lot more: triaging and fixing issues, handling security reports, reviewing code, updating documentation, and maintaining infrastructure. All of this work empowers the community and ensures PHP is stable and reliable.</p>

<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The total contributions to the PHP repositories grew by 51+%</li>
<li>We conducted the first external security audit for PHP in 10 years</li>
<li>We extended security support for PHP versions by one year</li>
<li>We improved CI and testing infrastructure</li>
<li>We introduced automated benchmarks to track performance regressions</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this would be possible without our sponsors. Huge thanks to every company and individual who has supported us over the past three years!</p>

<p>We‚Äôre off by two but still happy to bring you an update from the foundation.</p>

<p>It's been a month since the PHP Foundation began to fully deliver on its 2022 goal of hiring developers to work on the PHP core.</p>

<p>Backed by our awesome sponsors, six talented folks have already been doing their work for a whole month. Derick Rethans, Arnaud Le Blanc, Gina Peter Banyard, Jakub Zelenka, and M√°t√© Kocsis started on April 1, and Ilija Tovilo started even earlier than that.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve made the first <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation/expenses">payouts</a>, and we will continue making them regularly at the end of each month.</p>

<h2 id="how-were-the-devs-selected%2C-and-how-do-they-work%3F">How were the devs selected, and how do they work?</h2>

<p>We received about 70 applications in total. From them, we selected everyone who had significant experience making <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php-src</a> contributions.</p>

<p>We also now have a pool of a few other candidates, and we will consider involving them later.</p>

<p>All of the current developers are working part time, and everyone has different working hours. The developers devote 10‚Äì40% of their time exclusively to PHP core maintenance, bug fixes, code reviews, preparing proposals, and implementing new language features.</p>

<p>You can follow the Foundation team's work in real-time by looking at <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/commits/master">commits in php/php-src</a> and discussions in the <a href="https://externals.io/">Internals mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the PHP Foundation team, even more work on the PHP core is being done by Dmitry Stogov, Christoph M. Becker, and many other contributors to core and documentation. We‚Äôd like to give a big shout-out and thank-you to them!</p>

<h2 id="php-roundup">PHP Roundup</h2>

<p>We have started a separate <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/">PHP Roundup</a> newsletter that covers the development of the PHP core in more detail. Ayesh Karunaratne, the author of the <a href="https://php.watch/">PHP.Watch</a> website, is leading this initiative.</p>

<p>Check it out and subscribe at <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/">thephp.foundation/blog/2022/04/28/php-roundup-1/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="bigger-picture-and-roadmap">Bigger picture and roadmap</h2>

<p>Some folks have asked us whether there is a roadmap for PHP. The short answer is ‚ÄòNo‚Äô. But we‚Äôd be happy to grow to the point where we can have one.</p>

<p>The problem the Foundation was created to address will not be solved overnight simply because the funds become available. While PHP is in a better position than it has ever been in terms of financing, this doesn't do much to improve the bus factor. In other words, financing alone is not able to increase the availability of the expertise needed to execute the kinds of projects that would appear on a roadmap.</p>

<p>Financing allows us to cultivate expertise organically, which results in increasing the bus factor. That is precisely what we are currently doing. The only way to become an expert in PHP is by doing PHP. We are essentially paying contributors to become the kind of experts we will need in the future while at the same time compensating them for their valuable contributions in the present.</p>

<p>It has taken us six months to get this far. And there'll be a time, quite soon, when we can talk more extensively about the future.</p>

<h2 id="website-%E2%80%93-thephp.foundation">Website ‚Äì <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">thephp.foundation</a></h2>

<p>Thanks to the work of Matthew Weier O'Phinney, the foundation‚Äôs official website is now up and running. On its <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/">blog</a>, you can find all the updates and the PHP Roundup series.</p>

<p>The site is open source and is hosted on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/ThePHPF/thephp.foundation">github.com/ThePHPF/thephp.foundation</a>.</p>

<p>It is made with the Sculpin static generator and uses Tailwind CSS. There are some <a href="https://github.com/ThePHPF/thephp.foundation/issues">known issues</a>, and pull requests with fixes and improvements are welcome.</p>

<p>We will add pages about the foundation's structure and team shortly.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-to-our-sponsors">Thank you to our sponsors</h2>

<p>We‚Äôd like to give a shout-out to everyone for your continued support, we truly appreciate it ‚Äì the PHP Foundation is all of us!</p>

<h2 id="team-growth">Team Growth</h2>

<p>In September, we initiated an open call for new developers to join the PHP Foundation by launching an <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2023/09/06/application-form-2023/">application form</a>.</p>

<p>We received a total of 207 applications. From this pool, we selected a shortlist of 12 qualified candidates. Following a comprehensive review and input from existing foundation members, we further refined our selection to 4 outstanding individuals. We will soon announce the new members.</p>

<p>The primary focus for the new developers will be on the maintenance and modernization of PHP‚Äôs infrastructure ‚Äî a critical step towards ensuring PHP being a robust and forward-looking language.</p>

<p>The public work undertaken by our developers can be followed in our monthly <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/tag/roundup/">"PHP Core Roundup"</a> series, which highlights the ongoing progress and developments within PHP core.</p>

<h2 id="advisory-board">Advisory Board</h2>

<p>For our major sponsors, we offer exclusive insights through occasional digests that provide a deeper dive into discussions, debates, and early-stage developments. This not only keeps our sponsors abreast of the latest happenings but also allows them to see the direct impact of their support. This is one of the benefits of being an Advisory Board member.</p>

<p>We announced the advisory board initiative <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2023/03/31/php-foundation-update-march-2023/#a-new-benefit-for-major-sponsors-%E2%80%93-advisory-board-membership">in March</a>. Since then, 9 companies have joined the initiative with their representatives.</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/">Governing Board</a> that includes Automattic, JetBrains, Private Packagist, Symfony, Tideways, Zend by Perforce, and PHP fellows, we now welcome the Advisory Board members: Moodle, Shopware, Laravel, Ardennes-√©tape, Les-Tilleuls.coop / API Platform, Aternos GmbH, PrestaShop, CraftCMS.</p>

<p>There were several useful discussions within the group. Specifically, we‚Äôd like to highlight the one around <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property Hooks RFC</a>. The Advisory Board feedback helped to shape the proposal design significantly.</p>

<p>By the way, you can already try property hooks on <a href="https://3v4l.org/">3v4l.org</a>, thanks to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/SjonHortensius">Sjon Hortensius</a>.

<h2 id="sovereign-tech-fund-invests-in-php">Sovereign Tech Fund invests in PHP</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a> is an organization that supports the development, improvement, and maintenance of open digital infrastructure in the public interest. Its goal to strengthen the open-source ecosystem sustainably, focusing on security, resilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the code. STF is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) and supported by the German Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation GmbH (SPRIND).</p>

<p>We have collaborated with STF to create work plans for these specific projects: PECL overhaul, Testing tool for FPM, Security Audit, and Documentation improvements.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll share more details on each project early next year, and for now we are thrilled and grateful to the Sovereign Tech Fund for trusting us.</p>

<h2 id="security-audit-of-php-is-coming">Security audit of PHP is coming</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, STF is investing in PHP, and we are going to commission an audit of PHP's C code base. We expect security issues to be found. To mitigate possible bad perception, we aim to publish and fix the revealed security issues at the same time.</p>

<p>For this security audit, we are partnering with <a href="https://ostif.org/">The Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Inc</a> (OSTIF), a corporate non-profit dedicated to securing critical open-source projects. They have a proven track record of audits for <a href="https://github.com/ostif-org/OSTIF/blob/main/Completed-Engagements.md">popular open-source projects</a> such as cURL, Git, Linux Kernel, OpenSSL, Node.js, and others.</p>

<h2 id="reports-schedule">Reports schedule</h2>

<p>Although we promised to prepare quarterly reports, that unfortunately did not happen to be feasible. So for 2023, we fall back to one yearly report. The 2023 transparency report will be published in December.</p>

<h2 id="meet-us-at-the-conferences">Meet us at the conferences</h2>

<p>You can meet our team at the following conferences in late 2023:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://php.bettercode.eu/">betterCode(PHP)</a> ‚Äì Nov 27</strong></p>

<p>Jakub Zalenka will give a talk: "PHP 8.3: Changes and future plans". <br> 
Besides Jakub, there will be talks from Niels Dossche and Sebastian Bergmann.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://live.symfony.com/2023-brussels-con/">SymfonyCon Brussels</a> ‚Äì Dec 7‚Äì8</strong></p>

<p>You‚Äôll be able to meet and talk to our board members: Nils Adermann, Sebastian Bergmann, Nicolas Grekas, and Roman Pronskiy.</p>

<p>You might be surprised to see Derick Rethans‚Äô name in the list above. After all, he was listed as a PHP Fellow when we announced the Foundation last year. Shortly after we launched the Foundation, Derick informed us of his desire to focus his work on developing and maintaining PHP's core and that he wanted to apply for sponsorship from the Foundation to make this happen. To avoid any conflicts of interest, Derick stepped down from his administrative role before he applied for sponsorship.</p>

<p>We are incredibly happy that these core developers have agreed to join the Foundation, and we are looking forward to the great things we can do together.</p>

<h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>All participants of the PHP Foundation including administration members and developers are expected to abide by the <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contributor-covenant.org%2Fversion%2F2%2F1%2Fcode_of_conduct%2F">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<p>To ensure enforcement of the Code of Conduct we are setting up a dedicated team. Tobias Nyholm <a href="https://github.com/Nyholm">@Nyholm</a>, who leads <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsymfony.com%2Fcare">Symfony‚Äôs CARE team</a>, will be responsible for assembling and running the Foundation‚Äôs CoC team. Welcome aboard, Tobias!</p>

<h3 id="what%E2%80%99s-next">What‚Äôs next</h3>

<p>Our main goal for the next month is to set up a proper communication and development process. We will conduct several meetings to discuss technical and organizational matters.</p>

<p>Since the purpose of the Foundation is to train the next generation of internal developers, we want to emphasize maintenance and user-focused features to maximize our impact. As such, we will review the efforts and ensure the plans fall in line with such an agenda.</p>

<p>We would also like to reduce the bus factor of PHP. So whenever possible, developers will be expected to update the <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phpinternalsbook.com%2F">PHP Internals Book</a> to ensure that no knowledge is lost.</p>

<p>On the administration side, we plan to work on increasing the transparency of our operations: to shed some light on the governance structure, discussions, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="php-foundation-stands-with-ukraine-%F0%9F%87%BA%F0%9F%87%A6">PHP Foundation stands with Ukraine üá∫üá¶</h3>

<p>On February 24th, 2022, Vladimir Putin's Regime began an illegal war of aggression in Ukraine. There are no words to truly express our outrage at such disregard for human life.</p>

<p>Many PHP developers have lived in or are living in Ukraine, and the PHP Foundation is supported by many backers from Ukraine, including sponsors <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Foroinc.com%2Flets-stop-the-war-together%2F">Oro, Inc.</a> and <a href="https://opencollective.com/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmacpaw.com%2F">MacPaw</a>.</p>

<p>If you, like many in the PHP Foundation, are desperate to find a way to help, there are some organizations listed below that are working to provide humanitarian aid to people who are caught up in this war.</p>

<p>We are proud that many of our sponsors stand with Ukraine too. Here are just a few examples:</p>

<p>In November, the PHP Foundation was launched publicly and we‚Äôve seen enormous support from the community.
Thanks to all of you who have already supported the initiative! We‚Äôre planning to update you about our workstream activities on a monthly basis, and this is our first update post.
Let‚Äôs take a look at what we‚Äôve been working on!</p>

<h3 id="the-first-round-of-applications-is-now-closed">The first round of applications is now closed</h3>

<p>Since November, many developers have applied for sponsorship, and there were quite a few that we would be very happy to sponsor.</p>

<p>We are discussing the details with applicants and planning the budget.
In order to organize this correctly we need proper documents and agreements.
The JetBrains legal department and OpenCollective staff are helping us to prepare the required paperwork.</p>

<p>We plan to complete the preparations and sign the necessary documents in January.
After that, we will announce the list of the first batch of sponsored developers.</p>

<h3 id="how-we%E2%80%99re-making-decisions">How we‚Äôre making decisions</h3>

<p>So far, we have held three administration meetings where we discussed the pressing issues.
Each meeting and the decision-making process are documented in our organization on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/thephpf">github.com/thephpf</a>.
For now the details are hidden, but we would like to make these meetings and notes public at some point.</p>

<p>In the next few months, we plan to hold biweekly meetings and work on the foundation‚Äôs governance, rules, and bylaws.</p>

<p>The foundation pays <a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/#core_developers">10 developers</a> to work on the language. See what the foundation achieved in 2023 in the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/02/26/transparency-and-impact-report-2023/">Impact and transparency report</a>.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre opening a new round of applications for developer positions. We intend to decide on who we will hire by the end of October. If selected, you would start your work January 1st, 2025&#46;</p>

<p>The application form will be <strong>open until October 10, 2024</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="https://forms.gle/Ji7Vvj1y2bMf9pUz7" class="inline-block py-2 no-underline px-6 !text-white bg-[#7f52ff] rounded-3xl hover:bg-[rgba(127,82,255,.8)]">Apply</a>
</p>

<div class="alert">
    <span class="inline-block font-bold">Note: This is not a job for PHP developers or aspiring PHP developers.</span><br> 
The development of PHP is done in the –° programming language, and requires proficiency in system programming.
</div>

<h2 id="note%3A-team-size-is-unlikely-to-grow">Note: Team size is unlikely to grow</h2>

<p>While we won‚Äôt rule out the possibility of expanding our team, it‚Äôs likely we won‚Äôt pay more than the current number of 10 developers. Mindful of our budget limitations, we may rather consider restructuring or adjusting our team to make space for any outstanding applications that better help us meet our goals.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-requirements%3F">What are the requirements?</h2>

<p>As before, we require previous experience in PHP core development. Ideally you should have all, but at least some of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pull-requests / commits to <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/">php/php-src</a></li>
<li>Experience in writing PHP extensions</li>
<li>Participation in PHP mailing lists</li>
<li>Contributions to other open-source projects</li>
</ul>

<p>This time, however, we have a clearer idea of the tasks that can be engaged in and so the pool of considered candidates will be wider.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-going-to-work-on%3F">What are you going to work on?</h2>

<p>Strategic areas we‚Äôd like you to work on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Web APIs (json, PDO, streams, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list. We encourage you to <strong>provide as detailed a description of what you want to work on as possible</strong>.</p>

<p>Our primary selection criterion is <strong>pragmatism</strong>. We place greater emphasis on solutions that improve the developer experience and benefit businesses that rely on PHP, rather than new syntax features.</p>

<p>Out of scope:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pure documentation work</li>
<li>PHP packages</li>
<li>Websites</li>
<li>Translations</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-does-working-for-the-php-foundation-look-like%3F">What does working for the PHP Foundation look like?</h2>

<p>Working for the PHP Foundation offers a lot of freedom, but it also requires discipline. Your work will roughly consist of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>40% Triaging issues and fixing bugs</li>
<li>30% Working on strategic areas</li>
<li>20% Code reviews</li>
<li>&#62;10% Preparing RFCs and developing new language features</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, developing new RFCs is a fairly small part of the job. Most of the work is typical maintenance of an open source project.</p>

<p>We are a fully distributed team. You can work from any place<strong>&#42;</strong> and at any time. All communication is asynchronous via Slack, GitHub, and Email. We meet for synchronous calls 1-2 times a month.</p>

<p>Your work should be in line with the foundation‚Äôs mission statement, and we expect you to follow <a href="https://thephp.foundation/code-of-conduct/">the code of conduct</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>PHP Foundation Mission Statement</strong></p>
  
  <p>The PHP Foundation is a collective of people and organizations relying on the PHP language. Its mission is to ensure the long-term prosperity of the PHP language. The PHP Foundation focuses on providing financial support and guidance to PHP language developers to support its goals of improving the language for its users, providing high-quality maintenance, and improving the PHP language project to retain current contributors and to integrate new contributors. The PHP Foundation aims to promote the public image of the PHP language in the interest of retaining existing and gaining new users and contributors.</p>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with üíú are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="rfc-updates">RFC Updates</h2>

<p>Following are the RFCs and major pull-requests discussed, voted on, and implemented since our last update.</p>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-define-proper-semantics-for-range-function-by-gina-peter-banyard-%F0%9F%92%9C">In Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/proper-range-semantics">Define proper semantics for range() function</a> by Gina Peter Banyard üíú</h3>

<p>This RFC proposes to adjust the semantics of the <code>range()</code> function in PHP to throw exceptions or at least warn when passing unusable arguments to <code>range()</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>range()</code> function in PHP generates an array of values going from a start value to an end value. However, the current behavior of the function is complex and can lead to unexpected results. For example, if one of the boundary inputs is a string digit (e.g. "1"), both inputs will be interpreted as numbers. This RFC aims to address these issues and make the behavior of the <code>range()</code> function more predictable and consistent.</p>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-mb_str_pad-by-niels-dossche">In Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mb_str_pad">mb_str_pad()</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>This RFC proposes the addition of a multibyte string pad function to the mbstring extension. This function would work similarly to the existing <code>str_pad()</code> function, but with support for multibyte strings. This is a welcome addition for developers working with multibyte strings, as it will make it easier to manipulate and format these strings in PHP.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-nameof-operator-by-robert-landers">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nameof">Nameof Operator</a> by Robert Landers</h3>

<p>This RFC proposes to add a global <code>nameof()</code> function, which would return the name of a variable, class, function, or method as a string. This could be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as debugging, logging, or creating more informative error messages.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-marking-overridden-methods-by-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_overriden_methods">Marking Overridden Methods</a> by Tim D√ºsterhus</h3>

<p>This RFC proposes a way to explicitly mark methods that are intended to override methods from a parent class with a new <code>#[\Override]</code> attribute. If this attribute is added to a method, the engine shall validate that a method with the same name exists in a parent class or any of the implemented interfaces. If no such method exists a compile time error shall be emitted.</p>

<p>The similar concepts exist in Java, TypeScript, C++, C#, Swift, Kotlin, and other languages.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-deprecate-functions-with-overloaded-signatures-by-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_functions_with_overloaded_signatures">Deprecate Functions with Overloaded Signatures</a> by M√°t√© Kocsis üíú</h3>

<p>This RFC proposes to deprecate a number of functions that have overloaded signatures, meaning they behave differently based on the number or type of arguments passed to them. The goal is to make PHP's function signatures more consistent and predictable.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-deprecations-for-php-8.3-by-gina-peter-banyard-%F0%9F%92%9C%2C-christoph-m.-becker%2C-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C%2C-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus%2C-go-kudo%2C-andreas-heigl">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_3">Deprecations for PHP 8.3</a> by Gina Peter Banyard üíú, Christoph M. Becker, M√°t√© Kocsis üíú, Tim D√ºsterhus, Go Kudo, Andreas Heigl</h3>

<p>The aim is to clean up some of the older, less consistent parts of PHP to make the language more reliable and predictable. The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passing negative <code>$widths</code> to <code>mb_strimwidth()</code></li>
<li>The <code>NumberFormatter::TYPE_CURRENCY</code> constant</li>
<li>Unnecessary <code>crypt()</code> related constants</li>
<li><code>MT_RAND_PHP</code></li>
<li>Global Mersenne Twister</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="declined%3A-php-technical-committee-by-jakub-zelenka-%F0%9F%92%9C-and-larry-garfield">Declined: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/php_technical_committee">PHP Technical Committee</a> by Jakub Zelenka üíú and Larry Garfield</h3>

<p>This RFC proposed the creation of a PHP Technical Committee (TC) that would make decisions about technical aspects of the PHP language and its reference implementation. The TC would have been responsible for resolving technical conflicts between core developers. Despite the potential benefits, the community decided not to move forward with this proposal.</p>

<h2 id="notable-mailing-list-discussions">Notable Mailing List Discussions</h2>

<h3 id="callable-types-via-interfaces"><a href="https://externals.io/message/120083">Callable types via Interfaces</a></h3>

<p>The proposal suggests that callable types should be allowed to be represented as interfaces, which would allow for more precise type hinting and better static analysis. The sentiment in the thread is generally positive, with many participants expressing support for the idea. However, some concerns were raised about potential complexity and the need for careful implementation to avoid breaking existing code.</p>

<h3 id="interface-properties"><a href="https://externals.io/message/120403">Interface Properties</a></h3>

<p>The discussion starter suggests making it possible to define properties in interfaces and argues that this feature would align well with the deprecation of dynamic properties and could replace the current practice of specifying these properties in doc blocks.</p>

<p>Larry Garfield pointed out that interface properties are already included in the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property Hooks RFC</a>, which is expected to go to a vote soon.</p>

<p>David Gebler expressed his disagreement with the proposal, stating that interfaces in most languages don't support defining properties because they are generally seen as an implementation detail rather than a promise about supported behavior. He also mentioned that interfaces are essentially an alternative to multiple inheritance, and mandating fields as well as method signatures brings them very close to abstract classes. He also expressed concerns about multiple interfaces defining the same property, which could lead to conceptual confusion.</p>

<p>Some participants expressed support, noting that it could improve code clarity and reduce the need for doc blocks.</p>

<p>At the end of 2022, The PHP Foundation is a collective of 10 volunteer administrators and 6&nbsp;part-time paid developers who make nearly half of the commits to PHP language core and extensions.</p>

<p>The collective received $580,000 in donations from organizations, and 1400 people backed or donated to The PHP Foundation individually.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation‚Äôs main focus for 2022 has been the strengthening of maintenance for the PHP core, the project that lives in the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a> GitHub repository. This project is the home of the PHP language, where PHP‚Äôs interpreter is developed. Everyone who uses PHP benefits in one way or another from the work that is done in this repository.</p>

<p>The 6 part-time developers employed by The PHP Foundation started in April 2022. From April through November (the time of this report), The PHP Foundation staff were responsible for nearly half of the commits and reviews made in the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a> repository.</p>

<p>The foundation intends to expand its development efforts in 2023 by hiring an additional developer and increasing the number of hours that our current contracted developers are working. We plan to spend $678,000, including compensation and fees. Additional sponsor contributions will allow us to extend the developer team further.</p>

<p>Among other goals for 2023, we would like to address the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extend the foundation developers team.</li>
<li>Establish processes for continuity beyond the current administration group.</li>
<li>Improve communication with sponsors and decide on the level of involvement for them.</li>
<li>Explore strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities.</li>
<li>Improve the quality of the ideas and RFCs coming from the foundation.</li>
<li>Develop a high-level roadmap and vision for PHP changes sponsored by the foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outset">Outset</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation was initiated by JetBrains, Automattic, Laravel, Acquia, Zend&nbsp;by&nbsp;Perforce, Private Packagist, Symfony, Craft CMS, and Tideways. It was publicly <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/">launched</a> on November 22, 2021.</p>

<p>Intending to ensure the PHP language's success, a group of individuals and organizations have formed The PHP Foundation. Through part-time staff, community management, and a network of partner organizations, The PHP Foundation enables sustainable maintenance of the PHP interpreter.</p>

<h2 id="organizational-growth">Organizational Growth</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation's founding companies in 2021 included the following businesses, which took an active part in discussions about establishing and running the foundation:</p>

<p>Initial members:</p>

<ul>
<li>JetBrains</li>
<li>Automattic</li>
<li>Acquia</li>
<li>Private Packagist</li>
<li>Craft CMS</li>
<li>Tideways</li>
<li>Laravel</li>
<li>Zend by Perforce</li>
<li>Symfony</li>
<li>PrestaShop</li>
</ul>

<p>Representatives of these companies formed the initial administration group.</p>

<p>Many more companies with a vested interest in PHP‚Äôs prosperity, made a major financial contribution during the year. These are the companies that donated $10,000 or more:</p>

<ul>
<li>Livesport s.r.o.</li>
<li>OP.GG</li>
<li>EC-CUBE</li>
<li>Spryker</li>
<li>Polcode</li>
<li>Shopware AG</li>

<li>Digital Scholar</li>
<li>Ardennes-√©tape</li>
<li>RAKUS</li>
<li>Cambium Learning, Inc.</li>
<li>Paycom</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, there are 145 organizations and 1220 individual sponsors <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation">on Open Collective</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-staff">The PHP Foundation Staff</h2>

<h3 id="application-process">Application Process</h3>

<p>We accepted applications for sponsorship from November through December 2021. We received about 100 resumes, and we‚Äôve chosen 6 developers with a proven track record of contributions to the PHP language. We‚Äôve created a shortlist of promising candidates for future expansion of the program or to replace participants, if necessary.</p>

<p>Up until March 2022, we were negotiating the text of contracts. The legal departments at JetBrains and OpenCollective both supported us in this.</p>

<h3 id="the-team-as-of-2022">The team as of 2022</h3>

<p>Starting in April, we contracted 6 developers to work on PHP:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arnaud Le Blanc</strong> <a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">@arnaud-lb</a></li>
<li><strong>Derick Rethans</strong> <a href="https://github.com/derickr">@derickr</a></li>
<li><strong>Gina Peter Banyard</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Girgias">@Girgias</a></li>
<li><strong>Ilija Tovilo</strong> <a href="https://github.com/iluuu1994">@iluuu1994</a></li>
<li><strong>Jakub Zelenka</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bukka">@bukka</a></li>
<li><strong>M√°t√© Kocsis</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kocsismate">@kocsismate</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compensation-considerations">Compensation Considerations</h3>

<p>We have thought long and hard about what approach to use for remuneration. Given the different experiences of the chosen developers and the limited budget, we devised the following scheme.</p>

<p>We would take a conservative (safe) approach and accept 7 candidates with a proven record of work. We‚Äôd pay developers hourly, with a factor based on experience. This rate was chosen to meet developers' expectations, but to remain within the allocated budget.</p>

<p>In 2022, we offered all developers a 6-month contract to start. They all work as freelance contractors. In 2023, we offer yearly contracts.</p>

<p>With such an approach, we were planning to spend $329,000 per year, which was a safe number based on the funding at that time.</p>

<p>One of the candidates dropped out, and we eventually accepted only 6 candidates. That is one of the reasons we spent less money than expected. But sticking to our conservative approach made more sense to us in the initial year than spending everything at once, as it allowed us to build up savings to even out fluctuating income in the future.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2022">Goals for 2022</h2>

<p>The primary goal for the foundation in 2022 was to <strong>hire developers to maintain the PHP core</strong>.</p>

<p>We consider this goal accomplished. We'll look in depth at how much work has been done in the next section. The foundation demonstrated its reliability and effectiveness. We rolled out a sustainable process for supporting contributors. Now we are ready to scale and grow.</p>

<h2 id="contributions-to-php-core">Contributions to PHP Core</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation‚Äôs main focus has been contributions to <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a>, the primary repository for the PHP language.</p>

<h3 id="day-to-day-work">Day-to-day work</h3>

<p>On a daily basis, the PHP Foundation staff team contributes to the open-source repositories of the <a href="https://github.com/php">PHP GitHub organization</a>. The foundation team contributes in many forms: filing issues, reviewing pull requests, participating in discussions on mailing lists, triaging issues, submitting RFC proposals.</p>

<p>In this document, four categories of contributions are presented in more detail: commits to php/src, reviews of pull requests on php/src, submitted RFC documents, and documentation work.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-governance">The PHP Foundation Governance</h2>

<p>The Administration group consists of veteran PHP core developers, PHP community leaders, representatives of the founding companies, and other key stakeholders.</p>

<p>We spent some time discussing how to organize management effectively. However, we concluded that it was worth focusing on our primary goal early on.</p>

<p>So for the first year, we decided to keep the group of administrators declared at the launch active. And make it invite-only for the first year.</p>

<p>This allowed us to move faster. However, the negative effect is definitely the lack of transparency in the process.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this group will continue in 2023. And one of the goals will be to provide more transparency and establish a level of involvement for other key stakeholders from the PHP world.</p>

<p>We intend to make the ground rules more clear over the coming year, including the terms of participating in The PHP Foundation's governance and technical steering activities.</p>

<h2 id="financial-report">Financial report</h2>

<p>In 2022, PHP Foundation was financially backed by organizations and individuals with the goal of paying a competitive salary to as many core developers as possible.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-we-not-spend-all-donated-funds%3F">Why did we not spend all donated funds?</h2>

<p>There were multiple reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Our projected budget was planned in December 2021, and the developers only started working in April.</li>
<li>One of the top-rated candidates to whom we had allocated a large budget dropped out for 2022 and this significantly reduced our spending.</li>
<li>Being a young organization, we felt that having a bigger buffer is a wiser choice for the first year.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="goals-for-2023">Goals for 2023</h2>

<p>Our foremost mission remains the same: <strong>maintain and develop the PHP language</strong>. In this regard, we have two groups of more specific goals for the next year.</p>

<p>From an organization perspective, the main challenge will be to grow in a way that ensures the long-term sustainability of the foundation and the PHP language.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, we'd like our work to be more meaningful, in the interest of PHP users, and oriented toward a common direction rather than uncoordinated, more or less random ideas.</p>

<h3 id="organization-goals">Organization goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Extend the foundation developers team.</li>
<li>Grow the community of the foundation.</li>
<li>Improve communication and provide clear benefits for sponsors.</li>
<li>Explore strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-goals">Technical goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ongoing maintenance and development of  the PHP core.</li>
<li>Improve the quality of the ideas and RFCs coming from the foundation.</li>
<li>Develop a high-level roadmap and vision for PHP changes sponsored by the foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="budget-plan-for-2023">Budget plan for 2023</h2>

<p>In 2022, all sponsored developers worked part-time, between 1 and 2 days per week.</p>

<p>In 2023, almost all developers indicated a desire to increase the amount of time they devote to PHP, ranging from working on PHP for 2 days a week to full-time.</p>

<p>As a result, we will pay for the equivalent time of nearly 4 full-time employees in 2023, which is close to double the 2022 commitment.</p>

<p>With this plan, we expect to spend about $600,000 per year on paying developers‚Äô compensation.</p>

<p>Our collaboration with the OpenCollective platform has been positive, and we plan to continue operating under the umbrella of OpenSourceCollective in 2023. This means that in addition to the above-mentioned costs, we will also incur 10% in OpenCollective fees and about 3% in payment processing fees.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-the-foundation-has-extra-funds-in-2023%3F">What if the foundation has extra funds in 2023?</h3>

<p>We'd like to set aside at least 50% of an annual budget in reserves for unforeseen events.</p>

<p>If the PHP Foundation receives additional donations, we would be delighted to scale our efforts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the application form for new developers</li>
<li>Hire a technical writer to work on the documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thank-you%21">Thank you!</h2>

<p>The PHP language is a living entity and, as such, requires continuous support to address developer issues, resolve security vulnerabilities, and evolve to meet the needs of the future.</p>

<p>Based on the strong first year of the foundation, we are excited to continue and multiply the efforts in the next years.</p>

<p>With your help, we continue the mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP language.</p>

Getting paid for this work and not having a burnout. Sounds like a dream, doesn't it? But this is exactly the opportunity that the PHP Foundation provides to those who would like to develop and maintain the PHP language.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation is a non-profit organization, started in 2021 by Acquia, Automattic, Craft CMS, JetBrains, Laravel, PrestaShop, Private Packagist, Symfony, Tideways, and Zend by Perforce with a mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP language.</p>

<p>Since April 2022, the foundation pays <a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/#core_developers">six developers</a> to work on the language. See what the foundation accomplished in 2022 in the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/11/22/transparency-and-impact-report-2022/">Impact and transparency report</a>.</p>

<h2 id="we-are-opening-applications-for-new-positions-at%26nbsp%3Bthe%26nbsp%3Bphp%26nbsp%3Bfoundation">We are opening applications for new positions at&nbsp;the&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;Foundation</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation is almost two years old, and we are gradually introducing structure into our activities and organizing processes. We‚Äôre opening a new round of applications for developer positions. We plan to open applications every September from now on, so if you are unable to apply now, you will have another chance next year. We intend to decide on who we will hire by the end of October. If selected, you would start your work January 1st, 2024.</p>

<p>The application form will be <strong>open until September 30, 2023</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<a href="https://forms.gle/Ji7Vvj1y2bMf9pUz7" class="inline-block py-2 no-underline px-6 !text-white bg-[#7f52ff] rounded-3xl hover:bg-[rgba(127,82,255,.8)]">Apply</a>
</p>

<div class="alert">
    <span class="inline-block font-bold">Note: This is not a job for PHP developers or aspiring PHP developers.</span><br> 
The development of PHP is done in the –° programming language, and requires proficiency in system programming.
</div>

<h2 id="what-are-the-requirements%3F">What are the requirements?</h2>

<p>As before, we require previous experience in PHP core development. Ideally you should have all, but at least some of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pull-requests / commits to <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/">php/php-src</a></li>
<li>Experience in writing PHP extensions</li>
<li>Participation in PHP mailing lists</li>
<li>Contributions to other open-source projects</li>
</ul>

<p>This time, however, we have a clearer idea of the tasks that can be engaged in and so the pool of considered candidates will be wider.</p>

<h2 id="what-am-i-going-to-work-on%3F">What am I going to work on?</h2>

<p>Strategic areas we‚Äôd like you to work on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
<li>Web APIs (json, PDO, streams, etc.)</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not an exhaustive list, and if you would like to do something else, make sure to mention it in the form. The main criteria is a pragmatic approach. In this sense, we adhere to the position that Rasmus&nbsp;Lerdorf, the author of PHP, voiced back in 2014:</p>

<pre><code class="Text">And rather than piling on language features with the main justification
being that other languages have them, I would love to see more focus on
practical solutions to real problems. The password_hash() addition in
5.5 is a good example of addressing a real Web problem.
‚Ä¶
I know these are much harder and less sexy than adding a couple
of tokens to the yacc grammar, but when we start looking at a new major
release this is what I hear from people who are running PHP in
production environments are looking for. Language features are nice, if
they are well thought out, but significant infrastructure improvements
are nicer.

<h2 id="what-does-working-for-the-php-foundation-look-like%3F">What does working for the PHP foundation look like?</h2>

<p>Working for the PHP Foundation offers a lot of freedom, but it also requires discipline. Your work will roughly consist of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>40% Triaging issues and fixing bugs</li>
<li>30% Working on strategic areas</li>
<li>20% Code reviews</li>
<li>10% Preparing RFCs and developing new language features</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, developing new RFCs is a fairly small part of the job. Most of the work is a typical maintenance of an open source project.</p>

<p>We are a fully distributed team. You can work from any place* and at any time. All communication is asynchronous via GitHub, Slack, and Email. We meet for synchronous calls 1-2 times a month.</p>

<p><em><strong>&#42;</strong> We do not consider applications from persons residing in sanctioned territories.</em></p>

<p>Your work should be in line with the foundation‚Äôs mission statement, and we expect you to follow <a href="https://thephp.foundation/code-of-conduct/">the code of conduct</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>PHP Foundation Mission Statement</strong></p>
  
  <p>The PHP Foundation is a collective of people and organizations relying on the PHP language. Its mission is to ensure the long-term prosperity of the PHP language. The PHP Foundation focuses on providing financial support and guidance to PHP language developers to support its goals of improving the language for its users, providing high-quality maintenance, and improving the PHP language project to retain current contributors and to integrate new contributors.

<h2 id="php-core-roundup">PHP Core Roundup</h2>

<p>Here's a summary of what the foundation's developers have been working on lately:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">Arnaud Le Blanc</a> revised the RFC and implementation of multi-statement short closures. The proposal is now on vote. Arnaud has also finished the improvements to ini quantity parsing.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/derickr">Derick Rethans</a> continues to fix bugs in DateTime to make working with dates in PHP as reliable as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/Girgias">Gina P. Banyard</a> has made several improvements to the type system: true, null, and false standalaone types have been added, and Disjunctive Normal Form Types put on vote. Gina also made a few fixes in SPL.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/iluuu1994">Ilija Tovilo</a> implemented multiple improvements for enums and put a couple on vote. He also made many fixes, like for instance fixed line numbers in backtrace of multi-line (fluent) function calls.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/bukka">Jakub Zelenka</a> made various fixes and improvements to PHP-FPM and OpenSSL extension.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/kocsismate">M√°t√© Kocsis</a> makes improvements to stubs and other fixes.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All developers devote significant time to maintenance, including fixing bugs, reducing technical debt, and making life easier for everyone working on PHP.</p>

<h2 id="thank-you-to-our-sponsors">Thank you to our sponsors</h2>

<p>This month we are glad to welcome a new major sponsor who joined the PHP Foundation‚Äôs sponsors herd: <strong><a href="https://www.mollie.com/en">Mollie</a></strong>.  Thank you, folks!</p>

<p>By the way, we have updated the <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/#sponsors">Sponsors section</a></strong> on our <a href="https://thephp.foundation/">website</a>. It now shows all major contributors sorted by the amount of donation. Kudos to <a href="https://twitter.com/s_panteleev">Sergei Panteleev</a> for this tweak.</p>

<p>Shout-out to everyone for your continued support ‚Äì the PHP Foundation is all of us!</p>

<h2 id="other-ways-to-contribute">Other ways to contribute</h2>

<p>We are receiving many offers of help from every corner of the community. We are grateful for the offers. There are essentially two kinds of offers being made:</p>

<ol>
<li>An offer of development time</li>
<li>An offer of expertise</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-to-contribute-development-time%3F">How to contribute development time?</h3>

<p>The Foundation has limited resources to manage the developers we contract to work on PHP. For this reason, it is not sensible to assume the management of external developers.</p>

<p>Any external developer who is compensated for their time spent on PHP is, of course, welcome to make use of our public communication channels:</p>

<ol>
<li>Email as: <a href="&#109;&#x61;i&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x63;&#111;&#x6e;&#x74;&#97;&#x63;t&#64;&#x74;&#104;&#101;&#x70;&#104;&#x70;&#x2e;&#102;&#x6f;&#x75;&#110;&#x64;a&#116;&#x69;&#111;&#110;">contact@thephp.foundation</a></li>
<li>Communicate via issues on GitHub repos: <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">github.com/php/php-src</a>, <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">github.com/php/web-php</a>, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-to-contribute-expertise%3F">How to contribute expertise?</h3>

<p>As the foundation begins to mature, a couple of currently unfulfilled roles have emerged.</p>

<p>We will soon communicate the details of these roles.</p>

<p>We intend to compile a list of all expertise on offer; If you haven't done so already, please tell what expertise you would like to make available using public communication channels.</p>

<p>We just opened applications for PHP core language contributors: <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/09/17/application-form-2025/">The PHP Foundation application form for 2025 is now open</a>.</p>

<p>Here's the deal: <strong>the more sponsors we get, the more ambitious we can be with our plans</strong>. At a minimum, we finance maintenance and security support, but with more funding, we can continue high-reaching projects.</p>

<p>Your sponsorship could help us:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tackle long-standing bugs</strong> that have been bothering developers for ages.</li>
<li><strong>Implement cool new features</strong> that will make PHP even more awesome.</li>
<li><strong>Improve performance and security</strong> (because who doesn't want a faster PHP).</li>
</ul>

<p>And if we get enough sponsors, we might even venture into some experimental territory. Your support could lead to the next big breakthrough in PHP development.</p>

This would not be possible without the excellent work done by the&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;Foundation's team: they correct the problems we report, continuously improve performance and make the engine always more generic and modular, which not only enables us to innovate in FrankenPHP, but also benefits the entire ecosystem by making PHP faster and more reliable.<br />

<p>Here are some updates we‚Äôd like to share with you.</p>

<h2 id="generics-research-progress">Generics Research Progress</h2>

<p>One of our most anticipated projects is the research into generics for PHP. In August, we published a <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/08/19/state-of-generics-and-collections/">comprehensive report on the state of generics and collections in PHP</a>. This research is a crucial step towards potentially implementing generics in future PHP.  The further direction has not been decided yet, so we encourage the PHP community to review the report and provide feedback.</p>

<h2 id="welcoming-ben-marks-as-official-php-foundation-ambassador">Welcoming Ben Marks as Official PHP Foundation Ambassador</h2>

<p>We are thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhmarks/">Ben Marks</a> has stepped up as the official PHP Foundation ambassador. Ben is Director Global Market Development at Shopware, and  was a co-Founder of the Magento Association.</p>

<ul>
<li>Serve as a liaison between the Foundation and the broader PHP community.</li>
<li>Represent the Foundation at conferences and events.</li>
<li>Help communicate our initiatives and gather feedback from the community.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're confident that Ben's contributions will strengthen our connections within the PHP world and help us better serve the community's needs.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 2024, The PHP Foundation is a collective of <strong>9 volunteer board members</strong>, <strong>1 full-time operations manager</strong> sponsored by JetBrains, and <strong>10 developers</strong> paid part-time/full-time who make more than half of the contributions to the PHP language and its extensions.</p>

<p>In 2023, The PHP Foundation received <strong>$418,669 in financial contributions</strong> from organizations and individuals.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation‚Äôs main focus in 2023 was strengthening the maintenance of PHP core, the project that lives in the <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src</a> GitHub repository. This project is the home of the PHP language, where PHP‚Äôs interpreter is developed. Everyone who uses PHP benefits in one way or another from the work that is done in this repository.</p>

<p>The PHP Foundation demonstrates its growing impact on the language through an increased volume and velocity of code contributions and reviews. The 6 part-time and full-time developers contracted by The PHP Foundation were responsible for nearly half of the commits and reviews made in the PHP language.</p>

<p>Moreover, the foundation's presence and activities have led to heightened interest and activity in the PHP project overall, with the total number of <strong>contributions to the language growing by 79% compared to 2022</strong>.</p>

<p>At the end of 2023, the German government‚Äôs <strong>Sovereign Tech Fund chose to invest in The PHP Foundation‚Äôs mission</strong> by providing funding for a security audit and other long outstanding projects critical for the PHP ecosystem.</p>

<p>The foundation is <strong>expanding its development efforts in 2024</strong> by contracting 4 additional developers and increasing the number of hours that current contracted developers are working.</p>

<p>The foundation plans to spend up to $1,045,000, including compensation and fees. We are looking for additional sponsor contributions to allow us to continue these efforts in the next years.</p>

<p>In 2024, we aim to achieve the following strategic goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure sustainable sponsorship for the foundation.</li>
<li>Ensure that foundation developers focus on valuable tasks.</li>
<li>Promote PHP within the web development ecosystem.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-mission">The PHP Foundation Mission</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation was initiated by JetBrains, Automattic, Laravel, Acquia, Zend, Private Packagist, Symfony, Craft CMS, and Tideways. It was publicly <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/">launched</a> on November 22, 2021.</p>

<p>Since 2021, many companies and individuals have joined the initiative. To make the priorities of the foundation more clear and aligned, we‚Äôve <strong>updated the mission statement</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The PHP Foundation‚Äôs mission is to ensure the long-term prosperity of the PHP language. The PHP Foundation focuses on providing financial support and guidance to PHP language developers to support its goals of improving the language for its users, providing high-quality maintenance, and improving the PHP language project to retain current contributors and to integrate new contributors. The PHP Foundation aims to promote the public image of the PHP language in the interest of retaining existing and gaining new users and contributors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
So it defines 4 priorities of the foundation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Improve the language for users.</li>
<li>Provide high-quality maintenance.</li>
<li>Improve the project to retain current contributors and to integrate new contributors.</li>
<li>Promote the public image of PHP.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="organizational-growth">Organizational Growth</h2>

<p>Many companies with a vested interest in PHP‚Äôs prosperity made a major financial contribution during the year. These are the companies that contributed $10,000 or more in 2023:</p>

<p><strong>JetBrains, Automattic, Private Packagist, Craft CMS, Tideways, pixiv Inc., Mercari Inc., Symfony Corp, Aternos GmbH, Sentry, Ardennes-√©tape, Zend by Perforce, Les-Tilleuls.coop, Cybozu.</strong></p>

<p>Overall, 718 organizations and individuals sponsored the foundation in 2023 <a href="https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation">on Open Collective</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ThePHPF">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-sovereign-tech-fund-investment">The Sovereign Tech Fund Investment</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://sovereigntechfund.de/en/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a> (STF) supports the development, improvement, and maintenance of open digital infrastructure in the public interest. Its goal is to strengthen the open-source ecosystem sustainably, focusing on security, resilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the code. STF is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) and supported by the German Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation GmbH (SPRIND).</p>

<p>We have collaborated with STF to create work plans for these specific projects:</p>

<h4 id="pecl-overhaul">PECL overhaul</h4>

<p>The current system for distributing PHP extensions, PECL/PEAR, is outdated and prone to supply-chain attacks, making it unreliable for average developers. This leads to the creation of redundant tools and new security issues.</p>

<p>We proposed to rewrite the PECL installer, replacing the messy pear code and the inefficient website.</p>

<p>Follow the progress of <strong>the new tool ü•ßPIE</strong> here: <a href="https://github.com/ThePHPF/pie-design">https://github.com/ThePHPF/pie-design</a>.</p>

<h4 id="testing-tool-for-fpm">Testing tool for FPM</h4>

<p>Currently, the PHP project's testing framework lacks more specialized support for the automated testing of the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM), especially for issues that require higher load. We propose to develop an FPM/SAPI testing tool that can execute all applications and set expectations on the produced logs and server responses. This tool will be connected with a load testing tool (e.g., wrk) to simulate real-world usage and load.</p>

<p>The work has started in the <a href="https://github.com/bukka/wst">https://github.com/bukka/wst</a> repository with the plan to move it to the PHP GitHub organization when ready.</p>

<h4 id="security-audit">Security Audit</h4>

<p>PHP, like any other language, has its share of security issues. We are going to collaborate with a security research group for a comprehensive codebase audit and address the discovered issues. This will significantly improve the security of PHP and make it more reliable for developers and businesses.</p>

<p>The audit is being organized in partnership with <a href="https://ostif.org/">OSTIF</a>.</p>

<h4 id="documentation-improvements">Documentation improvements</h4>

<p>The current PHP documentation has several blind spots, with many functions and methods not covered at all. We propose to update and modernize the English PHP documentation, review and remove user comments, integrate 3v4l.org for interactive examples, and simplify the maintenance process. This will make PHP more accessible to new developers and serve as a reliable reference for experienced ones.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-governance">The PHP Foundation Governance</h2>

<p>In 2023, we renamed the Administration group to the <strong>Governing Board</strong> to avoid confusions and better align with industry standards.</p>

<p><a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/#admins">The lineup</a> of the group has not changed and consists of veteran PHP community leaders, representatives of the founding companies, and other key stakeholders.</p>

<p>One notable change compared to the previous year is a full-time operations manager sponsored by JetBrains in addition to the financial contribution.</p>

<p>We aim to establish a level of involvement for other key stakeholders from the PHP world through the Advisory Board and other initiatives.</p>

<h2 id="the-advisory-board">The Advisory Board</h2>

<p>To keep major sponsors of PHP abreast of the latest happenings in the foundation and allow them to see the direct impact of their support, we announced the advisory board initiative <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2023/03/31/php-foundation-update-march-2023/#a-new-benefit-for-major-sponsors-%E2%80%93-advisory-board-membership">in March</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/structure/">Governing Board</a> representatives from Automattic, JetBrains, Private Packagist, Symfony, Tideways, and Zend by Perforce, the <strong>Advisory Board includes members from</strong> Moodle, Shopware, Laravel, Ardennes-√©tape, Les-Tilleuls.coop / API Platform, Aternos GmbH, PrestaShop, CraftCMS.</p>

<p>Your company can <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/join/">become a member</a></strong> by contributing a minimum of $12,000 to The PHP Foundation as at least a Silver Sponsor.</p>

<p>In 2023, we had a team of 6 developers. All of them demonstrated a high quality of work and dedication to the mission of the foundation. We were happy to renew the contracts for 2024 as well as extend the total number of hours for developers requesting it.</p>

<p>We have also adjusted the compensation rates for developers to better reflect the market, as the rates had not changed since 2021.</p>

<p>We aim to review the rates every year based on the available funding and priorities.</p>

<h3 id="team-extension">Team extension</h3>

<p>As was mentioned in the previous transparency report, we aimed to extend the team. It did not happen in 2023 because one of the prospective developers could not join the team for personal reasons, and had to step down from PHP core development entirely. Again, this is <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/#the_bus_factor">the Bus Factor at its worst</a>. However, we were able to extend the team starting with 2024.</p>

<p>We accepted applications for developer positions from September through October 2023. We received about 200 resumes, and we‚Äôve chosen 4 developers with a proven track record of contributions to the PHP language and ecosystem.</p>

<p>We offered the new developers 6-month trial contracts so that the developers and the Governing Board can evaluate the results and then decide whether to continue the engagements.</p>

<h3 id="the-team-as-of-2024">The team as of 2024</h3>

<p>Starting from January, we now contract 10 developers to work on PHP:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arnaud Le Blanc</strong> <a href="https://github.com/arnaud-lb">@arnaud-lb</a></li>
<li><strong>David Carlier</strong> <a href="https://github.com/devnexen">@devnexen</a></li>
<li><strong>Derick Rethans</strong> <a href="https://github.com/derickr">@derickr</a></li>
<li><strong>Gina Peter Banyard</strong> <a href="https://github.com/Girgias">@Girgias</a></li>
<li><strong>Ilija Tovilo</strong> <a href="https://github.com/iluuu1994">@iluuu1994</a></li>
<li><strong>Jakub Zelenka</strong> <a href="https://github.com/bukka">@bukka</a></li>
<li><strong>James Titcumb</strong> <a href="https://github.com/asgrim">@asgrim</a></li>
<li><strong>M√°t√© Kocsis</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kocsismate">@kocsismate</a></li>
<li><strong>Saki Takamachi</strong> <a href="https://github.com/SakiTakamachi">@SakiTakamachi</a></li>
<li><strong>Shivam Mathur</strong> <a href="https://github.com/shivammathur">@shivammathur</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="team-timeline">Team timeline</h3>

<p>We established the following timeline for team review.</p>

<ul>
<li>January 2024: Developers start work according to the new contracts.</li>
<li>May 2024: Evaluate new developers, contracts are extended, expanded, or terminated after the first 6 months.</li>
<li>September 2024: Open applications for new developers, evaluate performance of the current group of developers.</li>
<li>October 2024: Evaluate applications, work out updates to compensation, decide on a budget.</li>
<li>November 2024: Renew contracts with existing developers, potentially sign contracts with new developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>And in 2025 we start the cycle again.</p>

<h2 id="retrospective%3A-goals-of-2023">Retrospective: Goals of 2023</h2>

<p>In the previous report, we outlined a few organizational and technical goals. Let‚Äôs look back and evaluate the results.</p>

<h3 id="organization-goals">Organization goals</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Extend the foundation developers team. ‚úÖ</strong><br/>
We did not grow in 2023 strictly speaking, but the work done in 2023 helped to build the ground for two contracted developers to go full-time, as well as to hire 4 new developers.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Grow the community of the foundation. ‚úÖ</strong><br/>
The foundation‚Äôs Slack became a hub for the community and helped to move initiatives.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Improve communication and provide clear benefits for sponsors. ‚úÖ</strong> <br/>
We created a <a href="https://thephp.foundation/join/#membership-deck">deck with benefits for sponsors</a> and started the advisory board initiative. <br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Explore strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities. ‚úÖ / ‚ùå</strong><br/>
We received investment from the Sovereign Tech Fund and started collaboration with OSTIF.<br/>
We did not explore any marketing opportunities. And there is a room for many more strategic partnerships.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-goals">Technical goals</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ongoing maintenance and development of the PHP core.  ‚úÖ</strong> <br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Improve the quality of the ideas and RFCs coming from the foundation. ‚úÖ</strong><br/>
One of the examples here could be <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property Hooks RFC</a>. Although it has not been voted on yet, we have put amazing work into it and consulted many different parties to make it as good as possible.<br/><br/></li>
<li><strong>Develop a high-level roadmap and vision for PHP changes sponsored by the foundation. ‚ùå</strong><br/>
The roadmap and vision need further development and discussion. However, we conducted several pieces of research, both quantitative and qualitative. Some of these findings were shared at conferences where we participated, including PHPCon Poland, SymfonyCon, and Laracon EU. We plan to continue this work.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="php-language-impact">PHP Language Impact</h2>

<p>On a daily basis, the PHP Foundation staff team contributes to the open-source repositories of the <a href="https://github.com/php">PHP GitHub organization</a>. The foundation team contributes in many forms: filing issues, reviewing pull requests, participating in discussions on mailing lists, triaging issues, submitting RFC proposals.</p>

<p>In this document, four categories of contributions are presented in more detail: commits to php-src, reviews of pull requests on php-src, submitted RFC documents, and documentation work.</p>

<h2 id="goals-for-2024">Goals for 2024</h2>

<p>Our foremost mission remains the same: <strong>maintain and develop the PHP language</strong>. We‚Äôd like PHP to be the best platform for users and for businesses creating web applications and APIs.</p>

<p>The main challenge for continuing the work of The PHP Foundation is to ensure sustainable sponsorship.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, the goal is to ensure that foundation developers work on valuable tasks.</p>

<h3 id="organization-goals">Organization goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Onboard new major sponsors.</li>
<li>Explore strategic partnerships and marketing opportunities.</li>
<li>Further develop the Advisory Board initiative.</li>
<li>Grow the foundation's community.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="technical-goals">Technical goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Ongoing maintenance and development of the PHP core.</li>
<li>Deliver the STF projects.</li>
<li>Improve the quality of the ideas and RFCs coming from the foundation.</li>
<li>Conduct research and surveys to define priorities.</li>
<li>Develop a high-level roadmap for PHP changes sponsored by the foundation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="budget-plan-for-2024">Budget plan for 2024</h2>

<p>In 2024, two of our part-time developers extended commitment to go full-time, and we contracted 4 new developers.</p>

<p>We have also adjusted the compensation rates for developers to better reflect the market, as the rates had not changed since 2021. As a result, our budget significantly increased.</p>

<p>With this plan, we estimate our annual spending cap at approximately <strong>$840,000</strong> for developer compensation.</p>

<p>Additionally, we anticipate receiving <strong>‚Ç¨205,000</strong> from the STF investment. These funds will be allocated to developer reimbursements and our partnership with OSTIF.org for an external security audit.</p>

<p>Our collaboration with the OpenCollective platform has been positive, and we plan to continue operating under the umbrella of the Open Source Collective in 2024. This means that sponsorships we receive are reduced by 10% for Open Source Collective fees and 1‚Äì5% for payment processing fees.</p>

<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>

<p>The PHP language is a living entity and, as such, requires continuous support to address developer issues, resolve security vulnerabilities, and has to evolve to meet the needs of the future.</p>

<p>Based on the strong second year of the foundation, we are excited to continue and multiply the efforts in the next years.</p>

<p>With your help, we continue the mission to support, advance, and develop the PHP language.</p>

<p>This initiative, hosted by the Eclipse Foundation, will focus on creating specifications for secure software development rooted in open source best practices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We hope that our specifications could inform the formal standardisation processes of at least one of the European Standards Organisations. Given the tight time horizon for implementation of the CRA, we believe that this immediate start will provide a constructive environment to host the technical discussions necessary for the stewards, contributors, and adopters of open source to meet the requirements set forth in these new regulations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At The PHP Foundation, we are committed to supporting the open source community, ensuring that the PHP language and its ecosystem are prepared for the upcoming regulatory changes.</p>

This step addresses the sustainability challenges within the Open Source Software (OSS) community, particularly affecting PHP and its ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="the-open-source-pledge%3A-a-commitment-to-sustainability">The Open Source Pledge: A Commitment to Sustainability</h2>

<p>The Open Source Pledge represents a commitment from member companies to provide meaningful financial support to Open Source maintainers. This initiative aims to prevent maintainer burnout and reduce the risk of high-profile security incidents that can impact the broader tech ecosystem.</p>

<p>The OSS community, including PHP, faces significant challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Security risks:</strong> High-profile incidents like Log4shell, XZ, and Heartbleed have highlighted the potential consequences of under-resourced projects.</li>
<li><strong>Developer burnout:</strong> Many maintainers, often volunteers, are feeling exhausted and leaving the very projects you might be using.</li>
<li><strong>Losing maintainers:</strong> The demanding nature of maintaining open-source software means we‚Äôre seeing fewer contributors over time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation%27s-role">The PHP Foundation's Role</h2>

<p>As the main funder and steward of the PHP language, we‚Äôve seen firsthand how a lack of funding impacts crucial projects. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Core language development:</strong> Keeping PHP up to date and improving it takes a lot of time and expertise.</li>
<li><strong>Security support:</strong> Without enough funding, PHP can‚Äôt address vulnerabilities quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Extension maintenance:</strong> Many essential PHP extensions are struggling to find people to maintain them.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation efforts:</strong> Keeping PHP‚Äôs extensive documentation current is always a big challenge.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-join-the-pledge">How to Join the Pledge</h1>

<p>The Open Source Pledge offers a structured approach to supporting OSS with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Minimum contribution: $2,000 per year, per developer on staff.</li>
<li>Transparency: Companies should publish annual reports detailing their payments.</li>
<li>Direct impact: Funds go directly to maintainers, supporting their crucial work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to supporting the PHP Foundation, our major sponsors <a href="https://packagist.com/">Private Packagist</a> and <a href="https://tideways.com/">Tideways</a> are already part of the <a href="https://opensourcepledge.com/">Open Source Pledge</a>.</p>

<h1 id="%5Caction-required%5C-join-the-pledge%5C%21">&#91;Action Required&#93; Join the Pledge&#33;</h1>

<p>We urge PHP-based companies, developers, and organizations to join the Open Source Pledge and <strong><a href="https://thephp.foundation/sponsor/">sponsor The PHP Foundation</a></strong>.</p>

<p>It's been a while since our last update, so today we‚Äôd like to shed some light on what the PHP Foundation has been up to in recent months. Topics include changes to the reporting schedule, a new initiative within the Foundation called the Advisory Board, conferences with Foundation members, and other news.</p>

<h2 id="new-schedule-for-the-foundation%E2%80%99s-updates-and-reports">New schedule for the Foundation‚Äôs updates and reports</h2>

<p>Last year we started by publishing monthly updates, followed by an annual report released in October. Check out the <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2022/11/22/transparency-and-impact-report-2022/">Impact and Transparency Report 2022</a> if you haven‚Äôt yet had a chance to do so.</p>

<p>Now that the Foundation has moved into a phase of steady growth and there are fewer administrative updates, we will publish an update and report once a quarter. The next report, the PHP Foundation 2023 Q1 Report, will come out in April.</p>

<p>As for the technical details and results of the Foundation‚Äôs developer team, nothing has changed. Every month <a href="https://aye.sh/">Ayesh</a> publishes a <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/tag/roundup/">PHP Core Roundup</a> where he talks about what‚Äôs kept the team busy and the accomplishments of other PHP contributors.</p>

<h2 id="the-php-foundation-is-now-on-github-sponsors">The PHP Foundation is now on GitHub Sponsors</h2>

<p>From the very beginning, we used <a href="https://opencollective.com/">OpenCollective</a> as our financial platform for collecting and distributing funds. We are very happy with and grateful for their service.</p>

<p>For some companies and individuals, though, it‚Äôs a lot easier to donate via GitHub Sponsors. To make it easier for them to pitch in, we‚Äôve opened a GitHub Sponsors page: <strong><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/ThePHPF">github.com/sponsors/ThePHPF</a></strong>.</p>

<p>We are going to use GitHub Sponsors only to <em>receive</em> financial support. The funds will then be transferred to OpenCollective on a monthly basis, and we‚Äôll continue to pay developers via OpenCollective, as before.</p>

<h2 id="a-new-benefit-for-major-sponsors-%E2%80%93-advisory-board-membership">A new benefit for major sponsors ‚Äì Advisory Board membership</h2>

<p>A major goal of the PHP Foundation is to provide a voice for PHP's users in its development, and one initiative is to create an Advisory Board to provide communication between sponsors and the foundation team.</p>

<p>The advisory board's role is to assist in setting priorities for the utilization of the developer time and resources that the foundation provides. In other words, the board helps the foundation determine how best to allocate its funds to support the most critical and beneficial initiatives for the PHP community.</p>

<p>The Advisory Board is a forum for members to discuss shared challenges and propose feedback on developer plans. It provides a platform to exchange ideas and bring forward community concerns. The Foundation will review common requests and sponsor impactful projects, but feedback is provided periodically and not all suggestions will be implemented. It is a shared communication channel for constructive dialogue and common goal-setting.</p>

<p>For the first iteration of the Advisory Board, any company that contributed $10,000 in the early stages of the PHP Foundation will be offered the status of a major sponsor and a seat on the Advisory Board through October 2023. After that, the status and membership will be based on the extent of each member‚Äôs contributions and their commitment to continued support.</p>

<p>Currently, membership on the Advisory Board has the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every month we provide developer plans ‚Äì a list of tasks that the PHP Foundation developers will work on in the near future. Advisory Board members can discuss these plans among their teams and provide us with feedback that they feel we should consider.</li>
<li>Advisory board members are welcome to share their pain points or ideas on behalf of their communities or organizations. Suggestions may be discussed by other members and will be considered by the foundation developers.</li>
</ul>

<p>‚ö†Ô∏è Note: All language decisions go through the established Request for Comments (RFC) process, which is not affiliated with the PHP Foundation. Language decisions are the purview of PHP Internals. It means that some of the PHP Foundation‚Äôs efforts may not make it into the language. But with the Advisory Board discussions, we expect increased quality and acceptance rate of the foundation‚Äôs RFCs.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre also looking into providing some exclusive benefits for individual sponsors and smaller business contributors, as well. What would sound interesting or lucrative to you? Let us know!</p>
