<p>Our last update was almost a year ago, and that was because we felt the PHP Core Roundup posts were getting stale and our previous format was repetitive and had a lot of changes that made the posts excessively long.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-php-core-roundup-series">The New PHP Core Roundup Series</h2>

<p>Today, we are trying a new format that we got rid of text that looked like a mere changelog, to a post highlighting the general momentum of PHP development. This also means we might not get to celebrate and mention all the contributions from the PHP Foundation members and the other contributors as we did in previous posts.</p>

<p>Maintaining a mature, reliable, and widely used programming language that continues to get new features and improvements for almost 30 years involves a lot of work! Maintaining PHP documentation, php.net infrastructure, translations, triaging issues and security reports, bug fixes, mailing lists, reviewing RFCs, and packaging PHP only to name a few, we have PHP contributors and PHP Foundation members putting a commendable amount of effort into improving PHP!</p>

<p>While these PHP Core Roundup series may not write about these contributions often because we want to keep these posts exciting and resourceful, we want to spread love to all the contributors to the PHP ecosystem 💜.</p>

<h2 id="php-release-cycle-updates">PHP Release Cycle Updates</h2>

<p>In April, we voted and accepted an <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/release_cycle_update">RFC</a> to update our Release Cycle policy.</p>

<p>The PHP Core team provided two years of active support, followed by only one year of security fixes. We now have a new release cycle that, from PHP 8.1 (released in 2021 November), all PHP versions now get <strong>two years of security fixes instead of one year</strong>. The two-year active support period remains the same.</p>

<p>Further, we have changed the active-support and End-Of-Life dates to align to December 31st of the calendar year. This makes the support and EOL dates more predictable.</p>

<p>Here are the updated active-support and EOL dates for the current line-up of PHP versions. Dates changed from the previously set dates are in bold.</p>

<h2 id="php-core-developments">PHP Core Developments</h2>

<p>A few days ago, PHP 8.4 reached its feature-freeze. PHP 8.4 is slated to be released on November 21st of this year.</p>

<p>The first release candidate for PHP 8.4 is already out — they are not production-ready, but they are available to try out and test PHP application on, either by compiling from <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/tags">source</a>, using <a href="https://windows.php.net/qa/">Windows binaries</a>, or in <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags?name=8.4-">Docker containers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="highlights-for-php-8.4">Highlights for PHP 8.4</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 is an important release that brings major new features, several updates to the build dependencies and underlying libraries, and a fair bit of deprecations to iron out some of the legacy and undesirable behaviors and features in legacy PHP versions.</p>

<p>Using various approaches, each PHP version brings a lot of performance improvements and security tightening too. In PHP 8.4, we continue this in this direction with several minor internal improvements as well as noticeable improvements in JIT, and PHP extensions such as mbstring, BCMath, XML extensions, PCRE, and more.</p>

<p>Further, PHP 8.4 unbundles IMAP, Pspell, OCI, and pdo_oci extensions. It means if you wanted to continue using them, you'll have to install via PECL.</p>

<h3 id="property-hooks-and-asymmetric-visibility">Property Hooks and Asymmetric Visibility</h3>

<p>One of the most important features in PHP 8.4 is that you can now use <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">property hooks</a> and declare property <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/asymmetric-visibility-v2">visibility separately</a> for get and set operations. Both of these features are thanks to the collaborative efforts of Ilija Tovilo and Larry Garfield. Ilija, funded by the foundation 💜, focused on the implementation. Meanwhile, Larry, a frequent contributor, worked on the specification and authored the RFC text.
Property hooks allow declaring virtual properties with "hooks" that get executed when the properties are accessed or set, and the hooks get called with the object in context, to run their own logic.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {
    public string $emailAddress {
        set {
            if (!filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
                throw new ValueError('emailAddress property must be a valid email address');
            }
            $this-&gt;emailAddress = $value;
        }
    }
}

$user = new User();
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'test@example.com'; // Allowed
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'not an email address'; // Throws ValueError
</code></pre>

<p>Property hooks open up a vast possibilities to leading to less boilerplate code, improve readability, and make PHP classes and their APIs more intuitive.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/property-hooks">Property Hooks RFC</a> is perhaps our longest RFC ever, detailing use cases and syntax such as short functions, using them in constructor-promoted class properties, how a subclass can override or call parent property hooks, how they work with other mechanics such as readonly, magic methods, references, arrays, etc.</p>

<p>We will be covering more about details and mechaniscs of Property Hooks soon in future posts.</p>

<h3 id="asymmetric-visibility">Asymmetric Visibility</h3>

<p>Another useful feature added in PHP 8.4 is the ability to set different visibility scopes for get and set operations. This comes in situations where exposing a class property to be <em>read</em> is desired, but not to <em>write</em>.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {
    public private(set) int $userId;

    public function __construct() {
        $this-&gt;userId = 42; // e.g. set from a database value
    }
}

$user = new User();
echo $user-&gt;userId; // 42

$user-&gt;userId = 16; // Not allowed
// Error: Cannot modify private(set) property User::$userId from global scope
</code></pre>

<h3 id="improved-html5-parser">Improved HTML5 Parser</h3>

<p>The DOM Extension in PHP 8.4 received a massive feature-update as well. Previously, the DOM extension only offered libxml2 to parse HTML, which has not kept up with HTML5. The DOM extension now offers new <code>Dom\HTMLDocument</code> and <code>Dom\XMLDocument</code> classes with the former supporting HTML5-compliant parsing support.</p>

<p>There are lots of new improvements in this space, including not only the <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/domdocument_html5_parser">HTML5 parsing support</a>, but also <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/opt_in_dom_spec_compliance">DOM spec compliance</a> and several small <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/dom_additions_84">additions</a> including adding support for CSS selectors.</p>

<h3 id="bcmath-extension-getting-%60number%60-class-and-new-functions">BCMath extension getting <code>Number</code> class and new functions</h3>

<p>The BCMath extension in PHP 8.4 now has classes with support for operator overloading support!</p>

<pre><code class="php">use BcMath\Number;

$num1 = new Number('22');  
$num2 = new Number('7'); 
$num3 = new Number('100');

$result = ($num1 / $num2) + $num1 - $num2;
echo $result; // 18.1428571428
</code></pre>

<p>Now, instead of using BCMath functions such as <code>bcadd</code>, <code>bcsub</code>, <code>bcdiv</code>, etc, you can now simply use standard operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>, etc.).</p>

<p>The new <code>BcMath\Number</code> class supports operator overloading, which cannot be done by userland PHP classes yet, but the BCMath extension implements it, so you can use them as if they were regular numbers.</p>

<p>The <code>BcMath\Number</code> class implements <code>Stringable</code> interface, so the objects can be used where a string is expected (like how the example above uses it with an <code>echo</code> call). Further, the class implements all <code>bc*</code> functions. For example, it's also possible to call <code>$num-&gt;add($num2)</code> or <code>$num-&gt;add('5')</code> and it returns a new <code>BcMath\Number</code> object without modifying the original object, which makes them immutable.</p>

<p>This comes from Saki Takamachi 💜, one of our new PHP Foundation members. She also made several new improvements including adding new <code>bcfloor</code>, <code>bcceil</code>, <code>bcround</code>, and <code>bcdivmod</code> functions.</p>

<h3 id="...-and-more%21">... and more!</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 is shaping up to be an impactful version, with features such as property hooks and asymmetric visibility we mentioned above, and a healthy amount of deprecations including deprecating <a href="https://php.watch/versions/8.4/implicitly-marking-parameter-type-nullable-deprecated">implicitly nullable parameter declarations</a>.</p>

<p>Further, PHP 8.4 will be released after some popular Linux distro versions in server space reach their EOL date (such as Ubuntu 18.04 and RHEL/CentOS 7), so we took this opportunity to bump the minimum required dependency versions for Curl (>= 7.61.0), OpenSSL (>= 1.1.1). The PHP 8.4 mbstring extension is also updated to with the latest Unicode Character Database version 16 data.</p>

<p>See the lengthy <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-8.4/UPGRADING"><code>UPGRADING</code></a> file for a complete list of changes, but we will also be covering the important ones in the upcoming PHP Core Roundup posts.</p>

<h2 id="what%27s-in-the-making">What's in the making</h2>

<p>On September 30th, PHP 8.4 reached its feature-freeze, which means PHP 8.4 syntax and features are now fixed; PHP 8.4 will get ironed out and the first GA release is scheduled for November 21st.</p>

<h3 id="pie-%3A-php-installer-for-extensions">PIE : PHP Installer for Extensions</h3>

<p>PIE is a new initiative to be an eventual replacement for PECL. It's still under development, but it will be able to download, build, and install PIE-compatible extensions.</p>

<h3 id="real-time-benchmarking">Real-time benchmarking</h3>

<p>Máté Kocsis 💜 <a href="https://externals.io/message/116323">was</a> working on a real-time fully-automated and reproducible <a href="https://github.com/kocsismate/php-version-benchmarks?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction">benchmark</a> for PHP. It is now active (with daily results available <a href="https://github.com/php/real-time-benchmark-data">here</a>).</p>

<p>Using these test suits, we now have reliable data on the performance improvements or degradation in each PHP version.</p>

<h2 id="php-security-audit-organized-by-the-php-foundation-%F0%9F%92%9C">PHP Security Audit organized by The PHP Foundation 💜</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation intends to conduct a security audit of the PHP source code. Derick Rethans 💜 has asked the PHP Internals mailing list for input on which sections of the PHP source code should be prioritized in this audit. Feel free to join the <a href="https://externals.io/message/121135">conversation</a> if you have suggestions.</p>

<h2 id="releases">Releases</h2>

<p>The PHP development team released two new versions in September 2023:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-09-28-1">PHP 8.2.11</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-09-28-3">PHP 8.1.24</a></strong></p>

<p>These releases include several bug fixes and improvements, notably in areas such as Core, DOM, Iconv, Intl, MySQLnd, ODBC, SimpleXML, SPL, and SQLite3.</p>

<h2 id="recent-rfcs-and-mailing-list-discussions">Recent RFCs and Mailing List Discussions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">issue tracker</a>, changes are discussed in <a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php">mailing lists</a>, minor code changes are proposed as <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">pull requests</a>, and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">PHP RFCs</a>. <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/">Documentation</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">php.net website</a> changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-release-page">PHP 8.3 Release Page</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php/pull/807">pull-request</a> for the upcoming PHP 8.3 release page on php.net is in progress, and you can help with that!</p>

<p>This is a continuation of <a href="https://externals.io/message/112026">a good tradition</a> started by Roman Pronskiy, Alexander Makarov, and the JetBrains design team.</p>

<p>Check out how these pages looked like for <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php">PHP 8.0</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.1/en.php">PHP 8.1</a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.2/en.php">PHP 8.2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="early-developments-for-php-8.4">Early-developments for PHP 8.4</h2>

<p>Although PHP 8.3 is still being ironed out, there are some discussions and even an RFC currently being voted for proposed changes in PHP 8.4 (scheduled for the end of 2024).</p>

<h3 id="declined%3A-support-optional-suffix-parameter-in-tempnam-by-athos-ribeiro">Declined: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tempnam-suffix-v2">Support optional suffix parameter in tempnam</a> by Athos Ribeiro</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add a new optional suffix parameter to the <code>tempnam()</code> function.</p>

<p>A suffix could provide even more semantic value or context for a user inspecting the generated files, and, in specific situations, could even provide more context for software processing such files. Right now, users can only add a prefix.</p>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-increasing-the-default-bcrypt-cost-by-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus">In Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023">Increasing the default BCrypt cost</a> by Tim Düsterhus</h3>

<p>The RFC proposes increasing the default BCrypt cost. This is to enhance adaptive security in relation to increased processing power and thus increased possible cracking speed.</p>

<p>The last time the value was updated 11 years ago. Therefore, Tim suggests updating the default cost from 10 to either 11 (double the time) or 12 (quadruple the time). The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023">RFC</a> and the relevant <a href="https://externals.io/message/121004">mailing list thread</a> mention several benchmarks showing the execution time for various cost levels on different CPUs.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-dom-html5-parsing-and-serialization-by-niels-dossche">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/domdocument_html5_parser">DOM HTML5 parsing and serialization</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add two new classes: <code>DOM\HTMLDocument</code> and <code>DOM\XMLDocument</code> to the dom extension. Furthermore, existing dom classes in the global namespace get an alias in the new DOM namespace. The <code>HTMLDocument</code> class will add support for HTML5 document parsing and serializing. The <code>XMLDocument</code> class serves as a modern alternative to <code>\DOMDocument</code>, which is retained for compatibility. These new classes also provide a more misuse-resistant API for loading documents.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-xml_option_parse_huge-by-niels-dossche">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/xml_option_parse_huge">XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add a new option to the event-driven (SAX) <code>XmlParser</code> that would allow it to parse large documents.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-add-4-new-rounding-modes-to-round-function-by-jorg-sowa">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/new_rounding_modes_to_round_function">Add 4 new rounding modes to round() function</a> by Jorg Sowa</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add four new modes to the <code>round()</code> function: <code>PHP_ROUND_CEILING</code>, <code>PHP_ROUND_FLOOR</code>, <code>PHP_ROUND_AWAY_FROM_ZERO</code>, <code>PHP_ROUND_TOWARD_ZERO</code>.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-a-new-jit-implementation-based-on-ir-framework-by-dmitry-stogov">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit-ir">A new JIT implementation based on IR Framework</a> by Dmitry Stogov</h3>

<p>RFC proposes a new JIT implementation that is based on a separately developed <a href="https://github.com/dstogov/ir">IR Framework</a>. The main advantage of the new approach is that PHP source code will be freed from the low-level details of JIT compilation. The downside is a longer JIT-compilation time.</p>

<p>Dmitry <a href="https://externals.io/message/121038">emailed</a> PHP Internals mailing list, which led to a lengthy discussion on the merits of the new JIT implementation.</p>

<h3 id="draft%3A-deprecations-for-php-8.4-rfc-by-niels-dossche">Draft: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_4">Deprecations for PHP 8.4 RFC</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>RFC is currently in draft, which stands to track ideas on deprecating certain features. So far those are related to the <code>DOMAttr::$schemaTypeInfo</code>, <code>DOMElement::$schemaTypeInfo</code> properties, <code>DOMImplementation::getFeature()</code>, <code>mysqli_ping()</code>, <code>mysqli::ping()</code> functions, and <code>DOM_PHP_ERR</code> constant.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>While PHP 8.3 has moved to the RC cycle, the documentation available on <a href="https://php.net">php.net</a>, requires updating. An initial version of the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration83.php">PHP 8.3 migration guide</a> has been published by Yoshinari Takaoka.</p>

<p>Gina P. Banyard 💜 is tracking the progress for PHP 8.3 related changes in <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues/2796">php/doc-en#2796</a>, and also triaged issues in the docs and marked several of them as "good first time", which are ideal easy picks if you would like to start contributing to PHP docs. You can find the full list on <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-feature-freeze">PHP 8.3 Feature-Freeze</h2>

<p>On July 18, PHP 8.3 branch reached its feature-freeze. As the name suggests, the list of features we plan to ship with PHP 8.3 is now frozen. Contributors who wish to make substantial changes to PHP should now target the next PHP version, PHP 8.4.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, the PHP Foundation members, the PHP development team, and contributors will be making improvements to get PHP 8.3 ready for production release.</p>

<p>Release managers elected for PHP 8.3, Pierrick Charron, Jakub Zelenka, and Eric Mann will have the final say in case a major change must be made to the PHP 8.3.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-beta-release">PHP 8.3 Beta Release</h2>

<p>The second beta release of PHP 8.3 was released this week. Now would be an ideal time to test your PHP applications on PHP 8.3.</p>

<p>Compiled Windows binaries are available at <a href="https://windows.php.net/qa/">windows.php.net/qa</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags?page=1&amp;name=8.3.0">Docker images</a> are available at Docker Hub, and source code at <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src repository on GitHub</a> to compile yourself. On Homebrew, <code>PHP 8.3.0-dev</code> packages are available from <code><a href="https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php">shivammathur/php</a></code> tap.</p>

<p>CI/CD platforms that use Docker images can use the PHP 8.2 docker images available with various base images. GitHub Actions can also make use of <code><a href="https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php">shivammathur/setup-php</a></code> action, which supports PHP 8.3 builds.</p>

<h2 id="php-bug-fix-releases">PHP Bug Fix Releases</h2>

<p>The PHP development team released two new versions in July 2023:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-07-06-2">PHP 8.2.8</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-07-06-3">PHP 8.1.21</a></strong></p>

<p>These releases include bug fixes across various components such as CLI, Core, Curl, DOM, Opcache, OpenSSL, PGSQL, Phar, SPL, and Standard.</p>

<h2 id="recent-rfcs-and-mailing-list-discussions">Recent RFCs and Mailing List Discussions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">issue tracker</a>, changes are discussed in <a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php">mailing lists</a>, minor code changes are proposed as <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">pull requests</a>, and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">PHP RFCs</a>. <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/">Documentation</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">php.net website</a> changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="rfc-updates">RFC Updates</h2>

<h3 id="accepted%3A-pdo-driver-specific-sub-classes-by-danack">Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pdo_driver_specific_subclasses">PDO driver specific sub-classes</a> by Danack</h3>

<p>PHP's PDO extension supports connecting to multiple database software by using different database drivers available. Some of these drivers include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Although most of these database support a common set of features, all of these databases have evolved to provide additional features that PDO <em>sometimes</em> can support, but there is no easy way for a library to check for these capabilities without having to inspect the driver and their versions.</p>

<p>This RFC proposes to create driver-specific sub classes of <code>\PDO</code>, so libraries and applications can easily indicate the database driver they expect, and make use of IDE autocompletion and proper error handling.</p>

<p>The vote was unanimously accepted, and is pending implementation.</p>

<h3 id="accepted%3A-deprecate-functions-with-overloaded-signatures-by-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C">Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_functions_with_overloaded_signatures">Deprecate Functions with Overloaded Signatures</a> by Máté Kocsis 💜</h3>

<p>This RFC proposes to deprecate a number of functions that have overloaded signatures, meaning they behave differently based on the number or type of arguments passed to them. The goal is to make PHP's function signatures more consistent and predictable.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-deprecations-for-php-8.3-by-gina-peter-banyard-%F0%9F%92%9C%2C-christoph-m.-becker%2C-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C%2C-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus%2C-go-kudo%2C-andreas-heigl">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_3">Deprecations for PHP 8.3</a> by Gina Peter Banyard 💜, Christoph M. Becker, Máté Kocsis 💜, Tim Düsterhus, Go Kudo, Andreas Heigl</h3>

<p>The aim is to clean up some of the older, less consistent parts of PHP to make the language more reliable and predictable. The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passing negative <code>$widths</code> to <code>mb_strimwidth()</code></li>
<li>The <code>NumberFormatter::TYPE_CURRENCY</code> constant</li>
<li><code>MT_RAND_PHP</code></li>
<li>Calling <code>ldap_connect</code> with 2 parameters</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-marking-overridden-methods-by-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_overriden_methods">Marking Overridden Methods</a> by Tim Düsterhus</h3>

<p>PHP 8.3 will have a new attribute <code>#[\Override]</code>. If this attribute is added to a method, the engine will validate that a method with the same name exists in a parent class or any of the implemented interfaces. If no such method exists, a compile time error will be emitted.</p>

<p>The similar concepts exist in Java, TypeScript, C++, C#, Swift, Kotlin, and other languages.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-path-to-saner-increment%2Fdecrement-operators-by-gina-peter-banyard--%F0%9F%92%9C">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/saner-inc-dec-operators">Path to Saner Increment/Decrement operators</a> by Gina Peter Banyard  💜</h3>

<p>This RFC proposed several improvements to normalize the behavior of <code>$v++</code> and <code>$v--</code> to be the same as <code>$v += 1</code> and <code>$v -= 1</code>, which PHP is currently inconsistent on.</p>

<p>It deprecates certain patterns, and introduces two new functions named <code>str_increment</code> and <code>str_decrement</code> to provide the deprecated behavior in a conscious way.</p>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-ga-to-be-released-this-month%21">PHP 8.3 GA to be released this month!</h2>

<p>PHP 8.3.0 GA is scheduled to be released on November 23rd. PHP 8.3.0 RC5 is already released, and RC6 (the last one) is scheduled for November, 9.</p>

<p>PHP 8.3.0 RC versions are available in <a href="https://rpms.remirepo.net/">Remi’s</a> repos for Fedora/RHEL, <a href="https://deb.sury.org/#php-packages">Ondrej's</a> repos for Debian/Ubuntu LTS, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags?page=1&amp;name=8.3">Docker images</a> on Docker Hub, and compiled Windows binaries on <a href="https://windows.php.net/">windows.php.net</a>.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.0-will-reach-eol">PHP 8.0 will reach EOL</h2>

<p>PHP 8.0 will reach its End of Life (EOL) and will no longer receive security updates after November 26, 2023. You can always check the release and support schedule at <a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php">php.net/supported-versions.php</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/post-images/2023/roundup-18/supported_versions_php.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="rfc-updates">RFC Updates</h2>

<p>Following are the RFCs and major pull-requests discussed, voted, and implemented since our last update.</p>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-straw-poll---how-to-name-the-process-resource-after-it-is-converted-to-an-object-by-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C">In Voting: Straw poll - How to name the Process resource after it is converted to an object by Máté Kocsis 💜</h3>

<p>As part of PHP's efforts in gradually phrasing out <code>resource</code> objects (<a href="https://github.com/php/php-tasks/issues/6">php-tasks#6</a>, <a href="https://php.watch/articles/resource-object">article on PHP.Watch</a>), this RFC polls the proposed names for the resource object class name that replaces <code>Process</code> resources. This ranked-choice poll (following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote#Example">STV</a>) intends to pick a name from <code>\Process</code>, <code>\ProcessHandle</code>, and <code>\OS\Process</code>.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-increasing-the-default-bcrypt-cost-by-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/bcrypt_cost_2023">Increasing the default BCrypt cost</a> by Tim Düsterhus</h3>

<p>RFC was approved unanimously, but in the second vote, where a new cost value had to be determined, opinions were divided.</p>

<p>The cost will be increased to 12 in PHP 8.4.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-xml_option_parse_huge-by-niels-dossche">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/xml_option_parse_huge">XML_OPTION_PARSE_HUGE</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>A new option will be added to the event-driven (SAX) <code>XmlParser</code> that would allow it to parse large documents.</p>

<h3 id="accepted%3A-dom-html5-parsing-and-serialization-by-niels-dossche">Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/domdocument_html5_parser">DOM HTML5 parsing and serialization</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 will get new classes: <code>DOM\HTMLDocument</code> and <code>DOM\XMLDocument</code> to the <code>dom</code> extension. Existing <code>dom</code> classes in the global namespace get an alias in the new <code>DOM</code> namespace.</p>

<p>The <code>HTMLDocument</code> class will add support for HTML5 document parsing and serializing. The <code>XMLDocument</code> class serves as a modern alternative to <code>\DOMDocument</code>, which is retained for compatibility. These new classes also provide a more misuse-resistant API for loading documents.</p>

<h3 id="accepted%3A-a-new-jit-implementation-based-on-ir-framework-by-dmitry-stogov">Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/jit-ir">A new JIT implementation based on IR Framework</a> by Dmitry Stogov</h3>

<p>RFC proposed a new JIT implementation based on a separately developed <a href="https://github.com/dstogov/ir">IR Framework</a>. The main advantage of the new approach is that PHP source code will be freed from the low-level details of JIT compilation. The downside is a longer JIT-compilation time.</p>

<p>The proposal was accepted, so Dmitry Stogov <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/12079">merged</a> the new JIT into the <code>master</code> which means it will be available in PHP 8.4.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-rfc1867-for-non-post-http-verbs-by-ilija-tovilo-%F0%9F%92%9C">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/rfc1867-non-post">RFC1867 for non-POST HTTP verbs</a> by Ilija Tovilo 💜</h3>

<p>Now PHP supports the parsing of <code>multipart/form-data</code> content type natively, but only for POST requests. If POST request has the <code>multipart/form-data</code> content type, the request body is immediately consumed before starting the PHP script and populated into the <code>$_POST</code> and <code>$_FILES</code> superglobals.</p>

<p>RFC proposes to add a new function <code>request_parse_body()</code> to expose the existing functionality to userland so that it may be used for other HTTP verbs.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-rounding-integers-as-int-by-marc-bennewitz">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/integer-rounding">Rounding Integers as int</a> by Marc Bennewitz</h3>

<p>Currently <code>round()</code>, <code>ceil()</code> and <code>floor()</code> functions return float numbers, but when using integers above <code>2^53</code> you get unexpected results due to loss of precision.</p>

<p>RFC proposes to perform rounding for a given integer and returning the resulting integer if possible.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-unbundle-ext%2Fimap%2C-ext%2Fpspell%2C-ext%2Foci8%2C-and-ext%2Fpdo_oci-by-derick-rethans-%F0%9F%92%9C">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unbundle_imap_pspell_oci8">Unbundle ext/imap, ext/pspell, ext/oci8, and ext/PDO_OCI</a> by Derick Rethans 💜</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to unbundle these extensions: remove them from the PHP source distribution, and move them to PECL.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-multibyte-for-trim-function-mb_trim%2C-mb_ltrim-and-mb_rtrim-by-yuya-hamada">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mb_trim">Multibyte for trim function mb_trim, mb_ltrim and mb_rtrim</a> by Yuya Hamada</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add multibyte support for trim functions.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-change-the-edge-case-of-round-by-saki-takamachi">Under discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/change_the_edge_case_of_round">Change the edge case of round()</a> by Saki Takamachi</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to change the <code>round()</code> behavior, and stop expecting decimal behavior to float point and start expecting floating point to behave as floating point.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>While PHP 8.3 is just around the corner, the documentation available on <a href="https://php.net">php.net</a>, requires updating.</p>

<p>Gina P. Banyard 💜 is tracking the progress for PHP 8.3 related changes in <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues/2796">php/doc-en#2796</a>, and also triaged issues in the docs and marked several of them as "<a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">good first time</a>", which are ideal easy picks if you would like to start contributing to PHP docs. You can find the full list on <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-branching-out">PHP 8.3 Branching Out</h2>

<p>PHP 8.3 has reached its <a href="/blog/2023/08/01/php-core-roundup-15/#php-8.3-feature-freeze">feature-freeze</a>, and <a href="/blog/2023/05/02/php-core-roundup-12/#php-8.3-release-managers-elected">release managers</a> branched out the PHP-8.3 branch on August 31.</p>

<p>Now that PHP 8.3 is in a separate branch, the <code>master</code> branch will be the development source for PHP 8.4. Bug fixes and other improvements will be cherry-picked for PHP 8.3 (and older branches) as appropriate, but new features that are made to the master branch will not be merged to the PHP 8.3 branch.</p>

<p>Tools that build PHP based on the Git branches will also see a new branch, and the builds from the <code>master</code> branch will be named “PHP 8.4” for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="releases">Releases</h2>

<p>The PHP development team released five new versions in August 2023:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-31-2">PHP 8.2.10</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-31-3">PHP 8.1.23</a></strong></p>

<p>These releases include several bug fixes and improvements, notably in areas such as CLI, Date, Core, DOM, FFI, Hash, MySQLnd, Opcache, PCNTL, SPL, and Standard.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-16-1">PHP 8.2.9</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-03-1">PHP 8.1.22</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-08-04-1">PHP 8.0.30</a></strong></p>

<p>All three include security fixes: <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-3qrf-m4j2-pcrr">GHSA-3qrf-m4j2-pcrr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-jqcx-ccgc-xwhv">GHSA-jqcx-ccgc-xwhv</a>.</p>

<p>PHP 8.2.9 and PHP 8.1.22 additionally include several bug fixes and improvements, notably in areas such as Build, CLI, Core, Curl, Date, DOM, Fileinfo, FTP, GD, Intl, MBString, Opcache, PCNTL, PDO, PDO SQLite, Phar, PHPDBG, Session, Standard, Streams, SQLite3, and XMLReader.</p>

<h2 id="recent-rfcs-and-mailing-list-discussions">Recent RFCs and Mailing List Discussions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">issue tracker</a>, changes are discussed in <a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php">mailing lists</a>, minor code changes are proposed as <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">pull requests</a>, and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">PHP RFCs</a>. <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/">Documentation</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">php.net website</a> changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="rfc-updates">RFC Updates</h2>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-support-optional-suffix-parameter-in-tempnam-by-athos-ribeiro">In Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tempnam-suffix-v2">Support optional suffix parameter in tempnam</a> by Athos Ribeiro</h3>

<p>RFC proposes to add a new optional suffix parameter to the <code>tempnam()</code> function.</p>

<p>A suffix could provide even more semantic value or context for a user inspecting the generated files, and, in specific situations, could even provide more context for software processing such files. Right now, users can only add a prefix.</p>

<h3 id="merging-postponed%3A-pdo-driver-specific-sub-classes-by-danack">Merging postponed: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pdo_driver_specific_subclasses">PDO driver specific sub-classes</a> by Danack</h3>

<p>This RFC proposed to introduce driver-specific <code>\PDO</code> sub-classes so applications can granular declare the specific PDO drivers they support.</p>

<p>This RFC vote was completed and accepted unanimously, but due to the implementation complexity, the changes for this RFC were not finalized before the PHP 8.3.0RC1 release. Because PHP 8.3 is beyond its feature-freeze and now that the first release candidate is released, the consensus seems to be that this RFC will not be implemented in PHP 8.3 but on the next PHP version.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>While PHP 8.3 has moved to the RC cycle, the documentation available on <a href="https://php.net">php.net</a>, requires updating.</p>

<p>Gina P. Banyard 💜 has triaged issues in the docs and marked several of them as "good first time", which are ideal easy picks if you would like to start contributing to PHP docs. You can find the full list on <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To make it easier to view the results of changes locally, Anna Filina has prepared a Docker Compose set-up. <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/pull/2638">Check it out</a>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 id="merged-prs-and-commits">Merged PRs and Commits</h2>

<p>Following are some changes that did not go through an RFC process because they are either planned, bug fixes, or progressive enhancements.</p>

<p>Thanks to the tireless efforts of the PHP Foundation members, the core PHP development team, and an incredible community of contributors, this upcoming version brings major new features and syntax, performance and security enhancements, and a healthy amount of deprecations.</p>

<h2 id="a-year-of-hard-work-and-collaboration">A Year of Hard Work and Collaboration</h2>

<p>The PHP Foundation financially supports ten PHP core developers. The PHP Foundation members, along with a total of <strong>115 contributors</strong>, have made over <strong>2,600 commits</strong> since PHP 8.3 until PHP 8.4.0 release.</p>

<p>PHP 8.4 includes changes from <strong>36 RFCs</strong>. There have also been numerous mailing list discussions and RFCs that were withdrawn, declined, or are still under discussion.</p>

<p>Since PHP 8.0, PHP 8.4 received the highest number of RFCs, and PHP 8.4 brings the changes such as property hooks and asymmetric visibility that received significant community involvement and refinement.</p>

<h2 id="what-php-8.4-brings">What PHP 8.4 Brings</h2>

<p>PHP 8.4 brings numerous new features and improvements to PHP. We covered some of them in our <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/02/php-core-roundup-19">previous post</a> as well, but they are mentioned here as well, for more complete picture.</p>

<p>As we also covered in <a href="https://thephp.foundation/blog/2024/10/02/php-core-roundup-19">PHP Core Roundup #19</a>, Property Hooks and Asymmetric Visibility are two of the highlighted features in PHP 8.4</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="php-8.4-supports-property-hooks%21">PHP 8.4 supports Property Hooks!</h3>

<p>In PHP 8.4, it is possible for a class to declare class properties with "hooks", that get executed when the property is accessed or set, and the hooks can access the object context.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.property-hooks.php">Property hooks</a> open up a wide range of use cases that allow classes to declare virtual properties that enable expressive and intuitive APIs, make code readable and simple and avoid boilerplate code.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {

    public string $emailAddress {
        set {
            if (!filter_var($value, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
                throw new ValueError('emailAddress property must be a valid email address');
            }
            $this-&gt;emailAddress = $value;
        }
    }

}

$user = new User();
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'test@example.com'; // Allowed  
$user-&gt;emailAddress = 'not an email address'; // Throws ValueError  
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Crell">Larry Garfield</a> wrote in <a href="/blog/2024/11/01/how-hooks-happened/">PHP 8.4: How Property Hooks Happened</a> about how he and Ilija Tovilo 💜 brought Property Hooks to PHP.</p>

<h3 id="asymmetric-visibility">Asymmetric Visibility</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 introduces <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.visibility.php#language.oop5.visibility-members-aviz">asymmetric visibility</a>, allowing different access levels for getting and setting class properties. This feature is useful when you want to expose a property for reading but not writing.</p>

<pre><code class="php">class User {  
 public private(set) int $userId;  
 public function __construct() { $this-&gt;userId = 42; }  
}  

$user = new User();  
echo $user-&gt;userId; // 42  

$user-&gt;userId = 16; // Error: Cannot modify private(set) property  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="lazy-objects">Lazy Objects</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 brings support for Lazy Objects. Using the Reflection API, it is possible to create class instances in PHP 8.4 that they are initialized only if needed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.lazy-objects.php">Lazy Objects documentation</a> provides detailed examples and use cases.</p>

<h3 id="html5-compliant-parser-in-dom-extension">HTML5-compliant parser in DOM Extension</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 upgrades the DOM extension with HTML5-compliant parsing. The new <code>Dom\HTMLDocument</code> and <code>Dom\XMLDocument</code> classes replace libxml2, which previously lacked HTML5 support. These updates improve DOM spec compliance and add features like CSS selector support.</p>

<h3 id="bcmath-adds-operator-overloaded-%60bcmath%5Cnumber%60-class">BCMath adds operator-overloaded <code>BcMath\Number</code> class</h3>

<p>The BCMath extension now includes the <code>BcMath\Number</code> class, enabling operator overloading for arithmetic operations.</p>

<pre><code class="php">use BcMath\Number;  

$num1 = new Number('22');  
$num2 = new Number('7');  
$num3 = new Number('100');  

$result = ($num1 / $num2) + $num1 - $num2;  
echo $result; // 18.1428571428
</code></pre>

<p>You can now use standard operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>) with <code>BcMath\Number</code> objects, which also support all <code>bc*</code> functions.</p>

<p>These objects are immutable and implement the <code>Stringable</code> interface, so they can be used in string contexts like <code>echo $num</code>.</p>

<h3 id="new-functions">New Functions</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/array_find"><code>array_find</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/array_find_key"><code>array_find_key</code></a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/array_any"><code>array_any</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/array_all"><code>array_all</code></a></li>

</ul>

<h3 id="pdo-driver-specific-subclasses">PDO Driver-Specific Subclasses</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pdo_driver_specific_subclasses">PDO Driver-specific subclasses</a> RFC is implemented in PHP 8.4. Previously, it was voted for PHP 8.3 but was not implemented in PHP 8.3 before its feature-freeze.</p>

<p>PHP 8.4 now adds <code>Pdo\Mysql</code>, <code>Pdo\Pgsql</code>, <code>Pdo\Sqlite</code>, <code>Pdo\DbLib</code>, and <code>Pdo\Firebird</code> classes that extend the <code>PDO</code> class. Driver-specific methods, properties, and constants are now available in the driver-specific subclass. Driver-specific sub classes also allow APIs to be more expressive and restrictive by allowing the functions and methods only to accept/return driver-specific sub-classes.</p>

<h3 id="%60aegis-128l%60-and-%60aegis256%60-support-in-sodium-extension"><code>AEGIS-128L</code> and <code>AEGIS256</code> support in Sodium extension</h3>

<p><strong>AEGIS</strong> is an AES-based family of authenticated encryption algorithms that is faster than AES-GCM. The Sodium extension in PHP 8.4 supports <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sodium-crypto-aead-aegis128l-encrypt.php"><code>AEGIS-128L</code></a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sodium-crypto-aead-aegis256-encrypt.php"><code>AEGIS256</code></a> encryption algorithms if the Sodium extension is compiled with <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium"><code>libsodium</code></a> 1.0.19 or later.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>Apart from the new features, PHP 8.4 also updates several underlying dependencies and datasets, as well as unbundling three extensions:</p>

<h3 id="updated-dependencies">Updated dependencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Curl extension now requires libcurl 7.61.0 or later, and even capable of making HTTP/3 requests if it is compiled with a supporting TLS library.</li>
<li>The PCRE extension ships with PCRE 10.44, which provides support for Unicode 15 characters and character blocks, improved Regular Expression syntax, and performance improvements on certain systems.</li>
<li>OpenSSL extension now requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later, with improved support for OpenSSL 3.x series. It can now support Curve25519 and Curve448 based keys. Further, OpenSSL can be compiled to provide Argon2 password hashing on OpenSSL 3.2+ on PHP NTS builds.</li>
<li>To compile PHP as an Apache module (<code>mod_php</code>), PHP 8.4 drops support for the EOL Apache 2.0 and 2.2 series. The minimum required Apache version is now 2.4.</li>
<li>The zlib extension now requires zlib version 1.2.11 at minimum.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unbundled-extensions">Unbundled Extensions</h3>

<p><a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/unbundle_imap_pspell_oci8">IMAP, Pspell, OCI8, and PDO_OCI8 extensions</a> are unbundled from the PHP core, and are now available as PECL extensions, for which <a href="/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/">PIE might help</a> to install easily.</p>

<h3 id="updated-php-icon-on-windows">Updated PHP Icon on Windows</h3>

<p>PHP 8.4 also brings a minor, yet <em>very</em> overdue change to the PHP icon on Windows executables:</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead%3A-php-8.4-and-beyond">Looking Ahead: PHP 8.4 and Beyond</h2>

<p>PHP 8.4 is the first major new PHP releases since the adoption of the new <a href="/blog/2024/10/02/php-core-roundup-19/#php-release-cycle-updates">PHP maintenance policy</a>. PHP 8.4, along with all current active PHP versions, will receive two years of active support and two years of security fixes.</p>

<p>What this means is that PHP 8.4 will receive bug fixes until the end of 2026 and security fixes until the end of 2028.</p>

<p>We just announced the pre-release of <a href="/blog/2024/11/19/pie-pre-release/">PIE - PHP Installer for Extensions</a>. PIE will significantly improve the workflow of downloading and compiling PHP extensions.</p>

<p>PHP 8.5 (in the <code>master</code> branch) is currently under active development, and we already have RFCs such as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures_in_const_expr">Support Closures in constant expressions</a> in voting phase, and <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/url_parsing_api">Add RFC3986 and WHATWG compliant URI parsing support</a> under discussion.</p>

<h2 id="get-ready-to-upgrade">Get Ready to Upgrade</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/releases/tag/php-8.4.1">PHP 8.4.1 is now a tagged release</a> on PHP's GitHub repository.</p>

<p>Compiled binaries and container images are available for:</p>

<h2 id="happy-28th-birthday%2C-php%21">Happy 28th birthday, PHP!</h2>

<p>On June 8, PHP turned 28 years old! For a throwback, see Rasmus Lerdorf’s <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi/c/PyJ25gZ6z7A/m/M9FkTUVDfcwJ">initial public announcement of PHP</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s to many more years of empowering developers and pushing the boundaries of web technology. Happy Birthday, PHP! 🎉🥳🎂</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3.0-qa-releases-and-feature-freeze">PHP 8.3.0 QA Releases and Feature-freeze</h2>

<p>The upcoming PHP 8.3 version is scheduled to be released on November 23. The newly elected PHP 8.3 release managers made the first QA releases of PHP 8.3 — <a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-06-08-3">PHP&nbsp;8.3.0&nbsp;Alpha&nbsp;1</a> — on June 08, and the <a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-06-22-1">second alpha release</a> on June 22.</p>

<p>These alpha versions aren't intended for production environments but are provided for testing and local development.</p>

<p>Compiled Windows binaries are available at <a href="https://windows.php.net/qa/">windows.php.net/qa</a>, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags?page=1&amp;name=8.3.0">Docker images</a> are available at Docker Hub. For macOS, PHP 8.3.0-dev packages are available via Homebrew from <a href="https://github.com/shivammathur/homebrew-php"><code>shivammathur/php</code></a> tap.</p>

<p>If you want to compile the source code yourself, you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src">php/php-src repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p><strong>July 18</strong> marks the feature-freeze for PHP 8.3. It means that all major changes to the language must be discussed and voted on prior to this date in order to make it to PHP 8.3.</p>

<h2 id="releases">Releases</h2>

<p>The PHP development team released three new versions in June 2023:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-06-08-2">PHP 8.2.7</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-06-08-4">PHP 8.1.20</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.php.net/archive/2023.php#2023-06-08-1">PHP 8.0.29</a></strong></p>

<p>All three include a security fix: <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/security/advisories/GHSA-76gg-c692-v2mw">GHSA-76gg-c692-v2mw</a>. The random byte generation function used in the SOAP HTTP Digest authentication code was not checked for failure. This could result in a stack information leak.</p>

<p>PHP 8.2.7 and PHP 8.1.20 additionally include several bug fixes and improvements, notably in areas such as Core, Date, Exif, FPM, Hash, LibXML, MBString, Opcache, PCNTL, PGSQL, Phar, Soap, SPL, Standard, and Streams.</p>

<h2 id="recent-rfcs-and-mailing-list-discussions">Recent RFCs and Mailing List Discussions</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Changes and improvements to PHP are discussed, reported, and voted on by the PHP Foundation Team, the PHP development team, and contributors. Bug reports are made to the PHP <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">issue tracker</a>, changes are discussed in <a href="https://www.php.net/mailing-lists.php">mailing lists</a>, minor code changes are proposed as <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues">pull requests</a>, and major changes are discussed in detail and voted on as <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc">PHP RFCs</a>. <a href="https://github.com/php/doc-en/">Documentation</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/php/web-php">php.net website</a> changes are also discussed and improved at their relevant Git repositories on GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
Hundreds of awesome PHP contributors put their efforts into improvements to the PHP code base, documentation, and the php.net website. Here is a summary of some changes made by the people behind PHP. Things marked with 💜 are done by the PHP Foundation team.</p>

<h2 id="rfc-updates">RFC Updates</h2>

<p>Following are the RFCs and major pull-requests discussed, voted on, and implemented since our last update.</p>

<h3 id="accepted%3A-marking-overridden-methods-by-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus">Accepted: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_overriden_methods">Marking Overridden Methods</a> by Tim Düsterhus</h3>

<p>PHP 8.3 will have a new attribute <code>#[\Override]</code>. If this attribute is added to a method, the engine will validate that a method with the same name exists in a parent class or any of the implemented interfaces. If no such method exists, a compile time error will be emitted.</p>

<p>The similar concepts exist in Java, TypeScript, C++, C#, Swift, Kotlin, and other languages.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-define-proper-semantics-for-range-function-by-gina-peter-banyard-%F0%9F%92%9C">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/proper-range-semantics">Define proper semantics for range() function</a> by Gina Peter Banyard 💜</h3>

<p>In the forthcoming PHP 8.3 release, the <code>range()</code> function will have improved behavior. It will now issue warnings or throw exceptions if it receives incompatible or unusable arguments.</p>

<h3 id="implemented%3A-mb_str_pad-by-niels-dossche">Implemented: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mb_str_pad">mb_str_pad()</a> by Niels Dossche</h3>

<p>PHP 8.3 will include a new function that works similarly to the existing <code>str_pad()</code> function, but with support for multibyte strings. This is a welcome addition for developers working with multibyte strings, as it will make it easier to manipulate and format these strings in PHP.</p>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-deprecations-for-php-8.3-by-gina-peter-banyard-%F0%9F%92%9C%2C-christoph-m.-becker%2C-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C%2C-tim-d%C3%BCsterhus%2C-go-kudo%2C-andreas-heigl">In Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_3">Deprecations for PHP 8.3</a> by Gina Peter Banyard 💜, Christoph M. Becker, Máté Kocsis 💜, Tim Düsterhus, Go Kudo, Andreas Heigl</h3>

<p>The aim is to clean up some of the older, less consistent parts of PHP to make the language more reliable and predictable. The following list provides a short overview of the functionality targeted for deprecation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passing negative <code>$widths</code> to <code>mb_strimwidth()</code></li>
<li>The <code>NumberFormatter::TYPE_CURRENCY</code> constant</li>
<li>Unnecessary <code>crypt()</code> related constants</li>
<li><code>MT_RAND_PHP</code></li>
<li>Global Mersenne Twister</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="in-voting%3A-deprecate-functions-with-overloaded-signatures-by-m%C3%A1t%C3%A9-kocsis-%F0%9F%92%9C">In Voting: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_functions_with_overloaded_signatures">Deprecate Functions with Overloaded Signatures</a> by Máté Kocsis 💜</h3>

<p>This RFC proposes to deprecate a number of functions that have overloaded signatures, meaning they behave differently based on the number or type of arguments passed to them. The goal is to make PHP's function signatures more consistent and predictable.</p>

<h3 id="under-discussion%3A-closure-self-reference-by-danack%2C-kapitanoczywisty">Under Discussion: <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closure_self_reference">Closure self-reference</a> by Danack, KapitanOczywisty</h3>

<p>This RFC proposes to allow closures to be aliased to a variable that can be used within the closure:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$fibonacci = function (int $n) as $fn {
    if ($n === 0) return 0;
    if ($n === 1) return 1;
    return $fn($n-1) + $fn($n-2);
};

echo $fibonacci(5);
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.3">PHP 8.3</a> is here! Bringing a handful of new features, performance and functionality improvements, and a healthy amount of deprecations, PHP 8.3 was released today.</p>

<p>PHP 8.3 will continue to receive active support for two years, followed by one year of security updates. Similar to the PHP 8.2 upgrade, the PHP 8.3 upgrade will be smooth as backward compatiblity is maintained. While some functionality is deprecated, there are no syntax, API*, and remove functionality in this release.</p>

<h2 id="what%27s-in-php-8.3">What's in PHP 8.3</h2>

<p>Some of the major new features in PHP 8.3 include support for declaring a type for class constants, improvements to support deep-cloning of <code>readonly</code> properties, improvements to the new Random extension introduced in PHP 8.2, new <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-validate.php"><code>json_validate()</code></a>,<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-increment.php"><code>str_increment()</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-decrement.php"><code>str_decrement()</code></a>, functions, and a noticeable amount of improvements in DateTime, DOM, and Intl extensions.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://www.php.net/releases/8.3">PHP 8.3 release page</a> for what's new and changed in PHP 8.3.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(*) Note that some of the PHP core extensions now declare types for built-in class constants. This is technically a BC break in case child classes declare the same constants without type declaration, which is only supported in PHP 8.3.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="upgrade-to-php-8.3">Upgrade to PHP 8.3</h2>

<p>PHP packages on software repositories such as Debian and Ubuntu repos maintained by <a href="https://launchpad.net/~ondrej">Ondřej Surý</a>, <a href="https://github.com/remicollet">Remi Collet</a> for Fedora/RHEL/EL already contain PHP 8.3 builds ready to install.</p>

<p>Windows builds for PHP 8.3 are available on <a href="https://windows.php.net/download/">windows.php.net</a></p>

<p><a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/php">Docker images</a> with PHP 8.3 will also be available on Docker hub in the coming days.</p>

<h2 id="php-8.3-release-in-numbers">PHP 8.3 Release in Numbers</h2>

<p>The PHP 8.3 release contains <strong>over 1200 code commits</strong> from <strong>114 awesome contributors</strong> to the <code>php-src</code> repository, and several more contributions to the documentation and its translations.</p>

<p>Contributions from the <strong>PHP Foundation members</strong> consist of over <strong>280 commits</strong>.</p>

<p>During the period from the PHP 8.2 release date and today, the <strong>PHP Internals mailing list has received over 2800 emails</strong>.</p>

<p>PHP RFCs, where major changes to PHP are proposed, discussed, and voted on, PHP 8.3 received <strong>23 RFCs that went to a vote</strong>, and <strong>18 RFCs passed</strong>. This includes a number includes "catch-all" RFCs such as Deprecations for PHP 8.3, where multiple changes were voted at the same time. Out of the 23 RFCs with votes, <strong>13 RFCs</strong> were either proposed or implemented by the <strong>PHP Foundation</strong> members.</p>

<p>The PHP documentation and php.net web site contributors have also made several impactful contributions to document the new features in PHP 8.3, prepare release pages, and more.</p>

<h2 id="%F0%9F%92%9C-thank-you-%F0%9F%92%9C">💜 Thank you 💜</h2>

<p>On behalf of the PHP Foundation, we take this post to thank everyone from this milestone in PHP. Your contributions to the PHP Foundation, code and documentation contributions, and several other ways of involvement and contributions help shape PHP to continue to be an exciting, feature-rich, and versatile programming language.</p>

<p>Thank you 💜</p>

<h2 id="php-8.4-outlook">PHP 8.4 Outlook</h2>

<p>PHP 8.4, scheduled for the end of 2024 is already taking shape. Even at the moment PHP 8.3 is released, there are three active RFC votes, and some major changes such as JIT-IR, a brand-new HTML 5 parser in the DOM extension based on <a href="https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor">Lexbor</a>, and Bcrypt default cost increasing already been implemented for PHP 8.4</p>
